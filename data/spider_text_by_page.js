    "text": "bear parade: eat when you feel sad (excerpt) by zachary german bear paraderaaaar. eat when you feel sad (excerpt) by zachary german this is the twelfth book in the bear parade series. It is comprised of excerpts from an early draft of Zachary's debut novel, to be released February 9, 2010 by Melville House. Pre-order it here. Zachary German was born on December 17th, 1988, at Shore Memorial Hospital, in Somers Point, NJ. He has a blog. blurbs i like this book a lot, the party parts are funny - tao / February 9, 2008 10:58 PM i read this while eating a sandwich. a toasted sandwich. i enjoyed 'eat when you feel sad.' i like how Robert spends most of his time trying to take off as many clothes as possible. i didn't like how one of the pieces of bacon on my sandwich was mostly white and translucent. - daniel / February 11, 2008 1:17 PM this book is funny. i felt good while reading it. i was afraid to read it at first. i only read a little bit and then stopped and then came back later and read the rest of it and i didn't feel bad ever. - m.s.s. / February 11, 2008 3:47 PM i liked this quite a bit. i read it all in one go and felt pretty much fine. i'm going to read it again (i bookmarked it)(in my internet browser). - jack kerns / February 11, 2008 7:54 PM This book delves into the isolation that can plague a sensitive twenty-something, and reveals the specific books, movies, music and t.v. shows the character chooses to help him make it through the week. German's dismal psychological profile is sadly accurate in many ways. - Susan Kirby-Smith / February 12, 2008 6:08 AM i identified with the main character of this book. i wasn't sure if i felt like he was cooler than me or not. i wasn't sure how i felt about that. i knew some of the music that he listened to. which was sort of gratifying. - maya / February 12, 2008 8:46 PM usually when i read something online i feel like i want to stop reading it. i will read a sentence and force myself to read another sentence. i didn't feel this way while reading 'eat when you feel sad.' every sentence made me feel like i wanted to read the next sentence. every sentence made me feel good. - brandon / February 12, 2008 9:54 PM This story really enhanced the facts that I also own a MacBook, listen to music, and eat bananas in my room. We are the same age. I keep thinking I should use the word \"solidarity\" in this comment. Okay, I just Googled \"examples of solidarity that I can understand\", but nothing came up. Then www.urbandictionary.com told me that it means \"a love for another person so intense and unyielding that it is potentially militant.\" Now I'm just not sure. I like your story. - hey / February 14, 2008 1:32 PM lil wayne FUCK YEAH - blake / February 14, 2008 3:47 PM i'm almost done reading this it's so amusing i wanted to give robert a hug and you seem to like lil wayne are you into hip hop music? - grace / February 15, 2008 7:37 PM i didn't actually read this whole book reasons why: a.) too tired b.) JUST KIDDING SMILE SMILE LOVE LOVE HAPPY FACES AND DOVES good job with the book you are only 19 i am only 19 you are in brooklyn i am in florida - jeffrey heart / February 16, 2008 2:19 AM i read it a lot i liked one sentence after another i like american apparel underwear after showering i liked reading this it felt right i feel like i could read it for a long time like if it just kept going i would keep reading it and not stop - colin / February 18, 2008 11:24 AM Enjoyable read. I used to use that stuff that clumps when I had two cats so I know hardened cat feces and urine all too well. - MD Corbin / February 18, 2008 12:46 PM I wonder what Robert's job is. \"Efficient\" made me think office. I also dug the metafictional bust-out when he doesn't call the girl, and the repetition of the phrase \"Broken Social Scene.\" Best HTML novel of 2008. - Andrew / February 19, 2008 4:51 AM i could relate to robert a lot. i'm in the middle of reading this for the third time and wanted to leave a blurb because i also sometimes think i can feel the oil moving on my face. i liked more than just that. i would buy robert beer. - megan / March 2, 2008 11:05 PM this was great. i did feel that you kept bringing up 'hip' bands to distract from the otherwise generic content. - sailor / March 11, 2008 8:12 PM It made me feel like doing all the things he was doing, and that kind of made me sad, but it was good :] - Casey / March 14, 2008 11:51 AM This story was funny but it makes me want to leave ironic (sardonic?) comments like everyone else that's read it. That makes me feel self-conscious and uncool. I almost deleted this blurb but now I'm typing more to justify how uncomfortable I am. - bill / March 18, 2008 7:31 PM Drink and You Will Feel Fucking Great only at http://bore-parade.blogspot.com - The Golden Bear / March 29, 2008 1:43 PM thank you all for your support. farrar, straus and giroux (fsg) has picked up ewyfs, the novel (of which ewyfs the bear parade book is an excerpt sort of). it will come out summer 09. thank you gene, tao everyone. this is so good. - zachary german / April 1, 2008 10:57 PM i can definitely relate to robert. he'll find some one. he likes good music and organic food, which makes me really smile. - emilee / April 3, 2008 3:39 PM I truly love this, it's a work of art that is so surgically precise with its words that it cuts like a scalpel to the heart of the reader. It's effortless to believe in Robert, It's effortless to sympathize with and love Robert, and it's effortless to feel moved by this quiet, unassuming story. You must understand, I did not simply feel entertained or pleasured by your work, but actually as if my life had been enhanced some by having experienced it. That might sound like grandiose flattery, but I'm quite serious. Thank you very much, I hope you can make the best of your beautiful talent. - Michael Wells / April 3, 2008 4:00 PM I haven't read his book, but I feel like it's okay to say that I'm glad I'm about to read it. - Philip Watts / April 18, 2008 4:19 PM zachary german looks like conor oberst. - dan / June 11, 2008 1:30 PM I read this alone in a room tonight after I applied for a grocery store job online and it took two hours because I had to do it twice and my application got ‘screwed up’ somehow and I couldn’t finish it and I have two college degrees and I just moved back with my parents and I read this book on my sister’s laptop because my computer is fucked. I liked it and I actually cried real tears while reading. “He looks out the window for three hours and fifteen minutes and then he takes a shower and then he puts on different clothes and then he rides his bike to work.” I like this sentence a lot. It made me feel like I just looked out a window for three hours and fifteen minutes. I laughed out loud four or five times. Good job. I will read this again when I am sad and need something. My sister has an old version of Internet Explorer and it cut off the text at the bottom like eight times so I actually did not read all of this. I will read this again so I can read the bottoms of the pages and the rest of it when I am at the library in a couple days or maybe tomorrow - chris / June 13, 2008 8:45 PM i am sorry for not testing the book on the old internet explorer. - gene / June 13, 2008 10:58 PM haha funny - sbh / October 31, 2008 6:31 PM I would like to know more about what happens to Robert next. I really care for him. - gravity / November 30, 2008 5:33 PM [in thirty years:] i read the new york times. I vomited. I live in greece. - i like this book. / December 14, 2008 1:49 AM I don't know how I got here, but I read it. It made me feel sad. I have heard all of the music and read all of the books and done all of the things and felt all of the emotions from the story. That makes me feel lonely and insignificant and like I was tricked. - kc / March 23, 2009 1:25 AM i think this should be inscribed on the side of a satellite and sent into space. - josh / April 2, 2009 11:41 PM i wish i had a life too - katherine / January 21, 2010 10:07 PM i couldn't stop reading. such a compelling view of what a meaningless life is like - just bland, simple, confusing. - skillz / January 25, 2010 11:41 PM i really like your stuff. i cat wait to read the next one. but..... \"The Blow. The percussion makes him feel okay. They lyrics remind him that he will meet some\" They (their)lyrics... not trying to be any kind of stickler- just thought because you had it posted you might want to change it. Cheers and tables, Elic - Elic / February 12, 2010 6:04 PM I thoroughly enjoyed this, I feel as if I know how Robert feels, to find his own place, to find acceptance/ company. I'm glad I read this, it makes me feel better... - del / May 12, 2010 7:57 AM hot, hot, hot. - mikae / January 6, 2011 4:02 AM"

    "text": "bear parade: small pale humans by daniel spinks bear paraderaaaar. small pale humans by daniel spinks this is the eleventh book in the bear parade series. Daniel Spinks was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He currently lives in Houston, Texas. His favorite board game is Mall Madness. If asked, he will say his favorite film is \"probably something by Truffaut.\" But really it's Point Break. blurbs this is yes. now i want to eat taco bell. - blake / December 1, 2007 3:10 AM i went to daniel's class a long time ago and he didn't say anything. then later he was at dinner with other people also and he talked about being afraid on airplanes i think. i don't think he and i said anything to each other at all through all of this. - tao / December 1, 2007 7:40 AM or like a year and a half ago. - tao / December 1, 2007 7:41 AM i just read the book again now. i think i've read it between 5-7 times now. good job daniel and gene. - tao / December 1, 2007 7:52 AM I am sad at my desk now, and it's snowing in Portland, Oregon. The snow was caused by this book and the snowflakes have tiny daggers. Thank you Daniel Spinks. - ofelia / December 1, 2007 12:14 PM it is also snowing here, in seattle. i can see daniel's book in my head growing larger and larger like a pancake in a very large pan. thank you daniel and gene. thank you philip. - billy sauce / December 1, 2007 6:52 PM I also feel very small and pale. The snowflakes have hit my forehead and now the space between my eyes, above my nose (what is that called, the uvula?) feels very strange and tight. Someone is humming a low tune and coughing in the snow outside the window. Thank you gene and daniel. And Philip Roth once again. - billysauce / December 1, 2007 6:54 PM i am listening to gnarls barkley and thinking about daniel's book. it is not snowing here in the bay area of california. i am thinking about the relationship between a married couple. i am thinking about the main character. i am thinking this book is really fantastic. thanks. - maya / December 1, 2007 7:45 PM at taco bell today, i thought about 'small pale humans' and i tried to think of a word for the moon. i ate three cheese quesadillas today. i think i was influenced by this book. - jillian / December 1, 2007 9:17 PM i want to print this book out and rub it all over my body. - prathna / December 2, 2007 12:51 PM i felt worried at the end like maybe i'd done something wrong that made there not be more. then i felt happy about how good it was. then i wanted to read it more times than i have time for. - colin / December 2, 2007 4:09 PM i remember talking about being afraid on airplanes. i always feel nervous eating in front of people so i spent most of my energy trying not to make eye contact with everyone. i wish it would snow in texas. everyone is nice. thank you for reading my book. taco bell. - daniel / December 2, 2007 4:50 PM After reading small pale humans straight through, I actually found myself enjoying it more the second time, jumping around from page to page, not trying to construct larger frames. Daniel Sprinks is an argument for the particular. He does it with exceptional grace. \"Grandpa\" Ron Silliman - Ron Silliman / December 3, 2007 5:39 PM Daniel, that was just me, Robert, a reader, posting as Grandpa Ron. I don't know what he would think of your bear parade book if he read it, but it doesn't matter. i really liked the last few sentences a lot. they made everything better than it already was. and it was pretty good to start. - Robert J. Baumann / December 3, 2007 5:42 PM I read this in my pajamas then drank guaifenesin and took a nap. I thought about it later. - Chris / December 3, 2007 9:39 PM I kept small pale humans with me this past week. Part of it was running laps in my head- such great lines had to be laughed about while people stared, wondering what was so amusing. The other part was on my laptop of course, when time allowed me the first thought was consume small pale humans again. Truly wonderful, the stress of the lack of Dr. Pepper has been felt. - Matt / December 5, 2007 9:46 AM This was a fun read with just enough absurdity mixed with the familiar and funny. And puking strawberry cupcake frosting probably wouldn't be all that bad after eating pennies. I've tasted book to know. - Sabra Embury / December 5, 2007 3:57 PM the gearbox in my van is broken. - mattt / December 14, 2007 8:52 AM Every Bear Parade book makes me want to write. That is the best compliment I think of right now. Thank you Daniel Spinks and Gene Morgan. I read this book many times because it is beautiful and funny and also because it is so short. That is the best thing about beautiful books that are short. You can read them many times without feeling tired. And This book does not make me feel tired but just the opposite. - Matthew / December 17, 2007 4:13 PM This & the \"3 Poems\" at ACTION YES give me hope that today's youngsters will understand how to do right. Keep frosting the lily & shooting potato gun soda cans at cats, Danny. Keep that copy of THE JOURNAL OF ALBION MOONLIGHT tucked under your pillow. Send me nudie pix of the chipmunk bride & I'll send back CDs and schizophrenic autobiographies. Hey, you put Bill's song in a poem. He slept on my couch for a few months after LC & he ended it all, taught me the three chords. . . . - matt Jasper / December 20, 2007 9:44 AM I liked this very much. - Bradley Sands / December 25, 2007 12:39 AM It's refreshing to find someone I can't quite relate to but still enjoy reading. True story- my fingers still smell like pickles for two days now and I swear that I washed them. Who knew that sardines would make the smell stick. - P.A. Rivera / December 27, 2007 12:38 AM this chased the loneliness right out of my early morning heart. and i'm pretty sure i've awoken with that small man on my chest. you got it bro. so short so perfect. slightly jealous. - saint jazz / December 27, 2007 12:48 AM this book entered the resting period. this book achieved or acheived i can never remember which one but it acheived or achieved penetration into things that i like. - wish it was wolfgang but it's not wolfgang / December 29, 2007 10:40 AM Not wolfgang should get a mac, because a mac would help you achieve the correct spelling of \"achieved\". Or not wolfgang should take an English class. That would also fix the problem. I like this book, too. It kind of made me sick. - Caroline / December 29, 2007 6:03 PM i like this book. - ~ / December 30, 2007 5:29 PM me too - pamplemousse / January 12, 2008 4:47 PM i'm at School. i was gonna pretend i was sick today and go home early and play my wii and Sleep. i think this comment box is broken because the words keep trail- ing outside of It. i felt good about Book. houston is COOL. - joe / February 5, 2008 2:11 PM Daniel Spinks made me laugh and laugh. And laugh. Small Pale Humans is the future, I am somewhat sure, or, at least it should be, a part of the future. What types of socks do they wear in the future? is what I would ask Spink's narrator. I would also ask Spink's narrator's wife; she seems to have a good head on her shoulders from time to time. This book was a joy to me; does that make me insane or brilliant? No, don't answer; leave it up to the wind. - Susan Kirby-Smith / February 20, 2008 6:27 PM daniel spinks shoudld write more. he should have a blog that he updates. - tee / March 19, 2008 6:43 AM daniel is a new hero of mine. i love how everyone's comments mimic his style, i guess it is quite contagious. i found myself speaking like him after reading small pale humans. eating can be a splendid crime. - emilee / April 2, 2008 4:56 PM i also laughed hysterically. thank you. - emilee / April 2, 2008 4:58 PM This art is so good that it just exists. - Michael Wells / April 3, 2008 4:51 PM i read this book when i was hungover. it was really good. i can relate to the feeling of having styrofoam between your brain and your skull. beautiful style. please write more. and put it on the internets. - joli / June 8, 2008 12:58 PM i like your muxtape a lot - zachary german / July 26, 2008 12:25 PM I'm not sure how it makes me feel. I've read it twice. I guess that's a good sign that I sort-of enjoyed it? Perhaps I shouldn't read when I feel like I don't know how I feel? I'd probably read something else by Daniel Sprinks or Sparks or whatever. Sprinks. I've been reading Thomas Hardy lately, so it seemed very strange how plain the style was. But I wouldn't really compare the two. Maybe plain isn't the right word. I don't care. This makes me feel like I don't care. - Robert / September 14, 2008 7:37 PM eerie fun catching well played and flung...quite worthwhile... i wish i wrote it ps i drank so much tea today; i puked. - brini / September 21, 2008 10:48 AM I think your uvula is in the back of your throat. I think spinks is a nice last name. - Michelle / February 24, 2009 4:13 AM Someone who drinks too much sent me the link to this. I read it while in bed, between two large, farting dogs. It made me laugh and feel lonely. - Richard / March 12, 2009 6:58 PM Nice - anonymous / May 12, 2009 5:49 PM How wonderful to find a story where the hero is not a hero, the plot is non-existent and the trials absurd and mundane. I loved it. My life is so empty. Will you give me meaning? - M / May 13, 2009 10:59 AM i wish there was more - kevin / October 3, 2009 11:44 AM it's 3:50 AM in the San Fernando Valley aka The Porn Capital of The World. I think I have to wake up at 6:30 am for work. Some days I just don't wake up at 6:30 am for work. Not sure how I feel about married couples, I'm not part of a couple nor married. I liked reading this short story. - justaddwater / October 6, 2009 5:54 AM i didn't finish it - werdfert / October 20, 2010 10:37 PM i stumbled upon this a couple of months ago. i come back to it whenever what i am reading leaves a stale taste in my mouth and i am afraid it will come back out like that so i need to remember what good writing tastes like. - lyric / November 3, 2010 8:21 PM"

    "text": "bear parade: compassionate moose by karen ashburner bear paraderaaaar. compassionate mooseby karen ashburner this is the tenth book in the bear parade series. Karen Ashburner lives in North Carolina. She is an elementary school teacher. She has a daughter who smells like peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies. She is the author of many chapbooks, poems, and online stories. If you google her name you can find some of them. She used to edit an online journal. Many people say it was a good journal. When she lived in New York City she got drunk a lot and ran out of money after she quit her teaching job. Sometimes she sits at her computer and takes photos of herself or writes whimsical, slightly harrowing stories about small children saying \"Fuck\" by accident in front of a school assembly into the microphone or running into the street to chase a ball thrown by an irresponsible but loving step-brother who now lives in Texas. She rarely gets drunk anymore. She is no longer broke and unemployed. She is still slightly oppositional defiant and harbors a strong resentment against the establishment that makes it necessary for her to buy sticks of cheese in individual plastic wrappers. blurbs i like it a lot - tao / August 27, 2007 10:33 PM I'm reading this book while listening to my daughter not sleeping in the other room as my wife tries for the third night in a row to get her to go to sleep despite her own lack of sleep because for some reason my daughter has refused three nights in a row to allow me to settle her back to sleep, resulting in no sleep for any of us plus extra guilt and feelings of futility for me as well. The book has been mildly comforting in the face of this situation. - adam / August 28, 2007 6:14 AM When I read this book the first time I was reminded of a memory. I wrote about the memory on Tao Lin's blog: In fourth grade I missed my mother so much I'd cry in the office and she would stand there in her pants-suit needing to go to work. My mother was a teacher then but not at the school I went to. She was paid a lot of money and was in a position where she could be late. I remember I was very sad then for some reason. Scared and screaming and crying. I thought I would never see my mother again. I always saw my mother again but I never thought I would see her again. So she gave me her wedding ring to hold onto and I kept it in one of my father's white handkerchiefs inside my desk at school. Someone in fifth grade used to go to the bathroom because he wanted to be alone and play with the small plastic action figures that used to come in cereal boxes. He had a bear from Golden Crisp and also Smacks the frog. My mother giving me her wedding ring was something like the Golden Crisp bear. I'd open my desk and open the handkerchief and feel consoled.

Good job to everyone involved. - Ken / September 22, 2007 3:43 PM these stories feel like if tao's \"a poem written by a bear\" were stories instead of a poem. i like them very much and think about the ending of \"moose language\" maybe every day. - colin / December 2, 2007 4:05 PM This is beautiful.

Tao Lin and Ellen Kennedy have a small press together called ASS HI BOOKS.

His website is at taolin.us and he has a Twitter account and a blog. blurbs People aren't blurbing, but whatever. I know it used to be a blog. This is something people should realistically enjoy and feel free to talk shit about. I get very happy reading this book. - Gene / April 4, 2007 11:12 PM I will blurb. I like this book. - Tao / April 5, 2007 6:15 PM i really liked this book it made me wikipedia hikikomori then i got excited about the idea of japanese young adults sitting in their rooms eating soybeans i also linked this book on my facebook so my friends will read it overall, it was pretty good i got up a few times during it to run around, and to eat mashed potatoes i did not listen to music while reading this book - maya / April 8, 2007 11:34 PM I feel this book wrongly glorifies the Hikikomori lifestyle. It may encourage the youth of America to lock themselves in their rooms with hamsters and other items. - Jason / April 11, 2007 1:36 PM This shit is weird - Thomas / May 1, 2007 9:12 PM What is going on. Actually, whatever. You guys are like pretentious but in such a promiscuous way, it makes me sick to my stomach. Alternatively, though, it's quite delicious with all that jazzy snazzy writing. Honestly, I can't resist buckling into a fantastic, semi-undesirable life described by the Hikikomori lifestyle! - Akshizzle / May 15, 2007 9:19 PM I think im kinda a Hikikomori. But Im not scared about the outside social world. But I stay inside alot. - \"Rone\" / July 20, 2007 3:40 PM I stay inside all the time. I'm 20 and I almost never ever leave my room. I browse the internet all day and look at funny pictures and tell people in chatrooms how great my life is and is going to be, but I never actually do anything besides stay inside all day and look at funny pictures on the internet. Your stories make me feel a deep sense of regret. Is that good or bad? - Hal / July 28, 2007 5:00 AM I should have read this on Thursday. On Friday I ate soy beans in their shells and didn't know to take the shells off, so I ate them whole. If I had read this first I would have known what to do. So I think everyone should read this at least once if only because knowing how to eat soy beans the right way can sometimes be important. - Gabriel / July 30, 2007 12:24 PM Remember: Everything is equivalent to Nothing. So i thought about this and really considered a decent sleep time. No conclusions. Enjoy Soybeans. Lets speculate, jobless writers, freedom. Who needs linear thought?

Except here in America, we don't have a word for it. We are just loser shut-ins. - hikikUSA / May 11, 2008 11:52 PM i laughed so hard and then i cried and made an organic smoothie. i feel alone too - amanda / May 24, 2008 8:12 PM I read this book all the way through, twice, and enjoyed it very much. I researched hikikomori for a grant I applied for a few years ago, so this was especially interesting to me. Also, I think natto is delicious. Thank you for sharing this on the Internet, Tao and Ellen. - Meg / June 20, 2008 12:28 AM lovely :3 - >:3 / August 9, 2008 8:18 PM i just renamed a folder on my desktop \"richard yates wearing a hotplate suit.\" - olivia / September 2, 2008 5:57 PM I stumbled across while doing research on hikikomori for my Japanese Society class. Not only was this a great piece, it provides an interesting Western perspective for my research. I read this. Then I bought a hotplate on ebay. - YongJoon / October 14, 2008 5:57 PM I really enjoyed this. - Kristen / October 25, 2008 11:13 AM i bought tao lin on ebay last week. today richard yates's corpse wearing a hotplate suit came in the mail. i am okay with this. - jesse / November 6, 2008 4:48 AM dear ellen and tao today i read a book on the internet. it was ok. sometimes it was nice but mostly i thought it was too silly. later i got up to take a piss. afterwards i didn't feel like moving so i fell asleep standing up in front of the toilet. now i feel lonely. john - john / December 10, 2008 8:58 PM this is very spectacular, what you have written together. - chlobot / January 17, 2009 12:28 PM Kind of creepy, but good, although I still don't know what hikikomori is. Perhaps I'll look it up on the internet. This book is like a David Firth film, but with more words. - L / April 5, 2009 1:30 PM i started reading this on some day of the week, but got sad and had to stop. then i went to the kitchen and thought about eating some almonds. i picked up eight or ten almonds in my hand, but i didn't eat any because i don't like almonds. sometimes i don't like anything. - laura / April 28, 2009 9:43 PM I have eaten fermented tofu before, and I can honestly say that it is the most revolting substance I have ever put it my mouth. - anon / May 5, 2009 1:58 PM fuck. - mario / May 11, 2009 7:43 PM this book is ok i guess. i will go cry now - ben / September 10, 2009 10:55 PM i read this carefully and that is so good. - maria / September 29, 2009 2:00 PM uhhh weird stuff....weird stuff.. - Joemonkey333 / October 10, 2009 3:26 PM i noticed that above the blurb box it says \"it will show up with a delay.\" i wondered how long the delay is. i stopped thinking about it and went into the kitchen and picked up a planter's jar of peanuts. i ate them. afterwards, i went back to the computer, read this some more and fell asleep. i woke up with tears streaming down my face. - mira / January 14, 2010 4:57 PM this made me sad. i read this an hour ago or so when i was talking online to my friend and they showed it to me and they said it was creepy but it wasn't. it was sad. or at least i think they said it was creepy. she said it was mentally scarring but it wasn't. sometimes i feel like a hikikomori because i spend a lot of time in my room but i actually don't like spending a lot of time in my room i hate it i like going outside and seeing people and i go out a lot. at least everyday. but i feel alone a lot and that makes me sad. like today i went outside so i could see my therapist and her name is brenda. she makes me draw stuff about myself and its weird but i like it kind of. but i dont like her much even though we share a lot of interests. i dont like her because she makes me feel like im making her mad. so i went home and i was quiet in the car because cars make me sleepy. and then when i went home i talked to my friend who showed me this again and that made me happy because then i didn't feel lonely like i do a lot and i told her i didn't like my therapist and she said is she kind of annoying? or nosy? or too nice? so i said I always feel like I'm making her mad and she said fffff dude therapists never get mad. and then i realized she was right and i felt better. and then i ate a pringle. they're kinda stale but they're still crunchy and taste good. but they still taste weird. - mae mae / January 18, 2010 4:21 PM Bicycles in my stomach go faster each day. - shirley / June 16, 2010 11:15 AM i wish it were true that all of these comments were fake and written as a strange new web 2.0 spin on poetry. they read like that might be true. but i guess actually all of these people wrote all of these words and they happen to sound poetic in an absurd and desperate kind of way. so it still works. chapter 6 i am drinking cider and reading the internet at work wishing that i were drinking cider and reading the internet not at work. - tim / October 14, 2010 1:38 PM the thing about fiction is it gives you pangs and makes you want to change your life but also tells you its impossible to change your life - alex Klein / December 7, 2010 12:55 PM"

I love it when I forget I'm reading. Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is another thing all together. A friend told me to read it, that I'd lurv it, but I don't, and I don't feel bad for it.

I can relate. - noah cicero / May 2, 2006 10:16 PM i yelled 'fuck' at five-year-olds across a river ellen yelled 'cocksucker' the five-year-olds were teenagers and they yelled 'shut the fuck up' and 'fucking retards' i yelled 'sorry' i stepped on ellen's head and climbed the ledge - tao lin / May 2, 2006 10:25 PM i just thought of a flying squirrel flying and missing the branch and falling on the ground then laying there for a few minutes very still. - ellen / May 2, 2006 10:54 PM i have horrible images of hamsters walking, five hundred hamsters walking, and walking slower and then walking slower and then very slowly stopping and laying down and making the sounds of five hundred hamsters laying down - tao lin / May 2, 2006 10:56 PM ellen todl me tot blurb her book and make nmaoney tyupoes so right nowa i am typing voery fast and straem of oscnoisncuness stylei and wahtever it hink int oredner to make manyt ypoes - tao lin / May 2, 2006 10:57 PM i am about to eat a nut bar - tao lin / May 3, 2006 7:27 PM Young Ms. Kennedy has replaced the need for sex with her genius. There is no more sex. There is only her book. And feet which all the big lit boys should get ready to kiss. - sean / May 5, 2006 2:33 AM Book, what book? I don't see no book. Where is the book? Oh that book, the one she said she'd never write-- great book, too bad she never wrote it. It's great, you should read it sometime. No, I don't have a copy I can loan you, buy your own. - Billy The Blogging Poet / May 7, 2006 10:02 AM ellen, you are a little weird, and a lot twisty, and made of stranger flowers than most other people. but i like it all very much. p.s. you have the same first name as my mom. i like that too. - katy / May 7, 2006 11:13 AM i am still looking for a new dress. sunflowers. - gene / May 10, 2006 10:41 PM fourteen lemon nut bars - tao / May 18, 2006 2:57 PM if you memorize these poems and proceed to fall from your bike, it will still hurt, but not so much as if you fell from the bike without knowing the poems. - nick / May 27, 2006 7:01 PM i saw my ass - taoq / June 2, 2006 11:07 AM Haven't finished reading this yet, but this HAS to be the highlight for me... \"i used schutzhund methods of training to teach the duck to attack on command. we went on a killing rampage that lasted three days. we killed many small children and received the nobel prize for our achievements.\" - P. H. Madore / June 10, 2006 11:22 PM the other day i went to the laundromat and i was the only one there. it was cool and quiet and it smelled fresh and clean. i thought i would like to be here by myself for a long time, just like i would like to spend a long time in ellen kennedy's book. - h.c.w. / June 15, 2006 2:33 AM i try not to stand on my own side during an argument - rylan / July 17, 2006 7:47 PM oh i thought these blurbs were closed. i thought it was something you read like on a page and i guess in a book if i was reading blurbs i could just write mine on the page but, it wouldn't count as much. i have read this book at least 5 to 6 times in the past 2 days. - arynne / July 30, 2006 12:59 AM I am interested- and today I thought of the 42nd floor of the glass box and remembered I still haven't left, but wish to tell others to get out NOW. - Ryan / February 21, 2008 1:37 PM This is my favorite Bear Parade eBook. I love Ellen Kennedy. I feel OK after I read this eBook or her blog. - Jeremy / February 24, 2008 7:37 PM spirit of the pen - brussel / May 17, 2008 5:06 PM i use to have a pet flying squirrel. it thought that i was it's mother because i rescued it when it was very very young from the clutches of a cat. the squirrel liked to go up on windowsills and then dive down my friend's tops whenever they came near him. it was funny for a while, but what most people don't realize is that flying squirrels have talons so they can attach themselves onto trees when they are tired of being in the air. and these talons are very sharp. anyways, one day the poor squirrel flew from the windowsill into my toilet and drowned. i was very sad. - katie pedersen / May 30, 2008 10:55 AM when I walk around my spaceship i always get a bit nostalgic. like i want to go back to my livingroom and be told by my mother to turn the tv off. i think she's late. i should have turned it off earlier. now there's the spaceship and it's just there you can feel it. - jack / July 16, 2008 2:57 PM I lay in my bed, on my back with my eight month old laptop on my stomach, reading odd poems and listening to Glorious by Muse. Being the person I am, I wonder about something (can't remember what it was now), exhale, and stop breathing. Thirty second slowly tick by and I finally gasp for air. I exhale again and stop breathing again. I realize I feel an odd pulse in my midsection. My laptop gently bobs up and down to the odd pulse. A muscle twitches in my left leg. I slowlyinhale the stale air of my small room, exhale, and stop breathing. After a second, the pulsing starts. I wonder what could be the cause of this, this odd pulsing in my body. I repeat: inhale, exhale, stop. The pulsing starts up again. My muscles twitch. I soon realize that the odd pulsing is coming from my chest, behind my breast bone. My heart. It beats. My head swells as it tries to get me to inhale the stale air, but I'm to fasinated by the pulsing of my heart. It beats! It really beats! I think to myself. I make up a tune to the rhythm of my heart, though, it is rudely interrupted by the annoying ache of my lungs, the swelling of my head. I just simply ignore it. I restart my tune. And what a joyous tune it was. After a while, I notice that the ache my lungs has vanished. The swelling feeling, too. I'm glad, until I look up and see myself staring up at myself. I look rather empty and pale. I wonder when a mirror got on my ceiling. I look behind me, just to realize that there is no mirror on ceiling. That my surroundings are still the same. I reach toward the reflection, but stop when I notice my hand. It's rather transparent. I look back at the reflection. It looked at me, wide eyed, the pupils so dialated that the brown-grey iris are just thin, thin bands lining it. Then it clicked. \"Man! Damn it all!\" ~N.J.W - Nao Wilson / September 28, 2008 10:02 PM subject: why life is unbelievably stupid once i heard some good things about miranda july, and someone mentioned the name of tao lin in connection with the name of mirandy july (i can see why now). i wanted to read something by tao lin, who i thought at the time was much more of an established professional or something. more like miranda july. but since i was wrong, there was never anything by tao lin in the bookstore and anyway i couldn't decide whether it would be under T for tao or L for lin since it's an asian name and i don't know which name is supposed to be the first name, or whether the first name would be the last name even if i did know. (now i live in hungary.) anyway, i forgot all about tao lin for something like 3 years, and then one day i was writing something and trying to randomly invent an asian-sounding name and my brain allowed me to write \"tao lin.\" but something made me decide to look up whether someone or something with this name already exists to make sure it was an okay name to use. why did i do this? i have never invented names before, let alone asian names, and if i had i wouldn't have looked them up! i remembered about tao lin because i had invented his name on accident. then today i decided to finally look something up about this tao lin and read a couple of his stories and then started looking at the other people he linked to in his blog, which included ellen kennedy, and i read a couple of her stories and read her biography on bear parade and read the comments to this biography. now i have to go back in time and write about how i used to talk to some person online and we would read each other's livejournals and then i met this person in real life and he gave me a copy of his poetry signed in blood but then he called me a cunt because i wouldn't give him a blowjob. this person was the person called \"sean\" who commented on the biography of ellen kennedy something about feet, which is how i knew it was the same person. anyway if you see sean please tell him it was me who left that amazing comment on his livejournal a couple months ago and that he is the one who is the cunt. but the point is that my first name is also ellen, which is why i am angry now because if i ever publish anything or whatever i will have to change my name. i hate the internet. don't approve this. - nothing / October 28, 2008 9:16 AM I think this made me think I'm not as crazy as I thought. Or maybe that I'm not as crazy as I'd like to be or to think I am. Probably it just filled out some of my time, but I think I'd read it again, so there's that. - Robert / January 3, 2009 5:40 PM Should \"nothing\" return: I know who you are and that you are cruel and delusional. The event you described transpired a long time ago, sweetie. You sound like a stalker. No man enjoys that, especially Sean, who's mine. It would be in your best interest not to leave him additional \"amazing\" (God help you) comments or speak to or about him in any manner whatsoever. Good luck in your attempt to \"ever publish anything or whatever,\" you fucking bitch. To the administrator: Posting this comment would be appreciated, though I apologize for the outburst. As a fellow writer, I mean no disrespect. Just looking after my own. - DH / February 25, 2009 8:55 PM I read the parts in Ellen Kennedy's book about killing children and initially thought, \"That sounds terrible.\" Then I realized that I've killed pretend children, before. In real life, I will never kill children. I doubt Ellen Kennedy will ever kill children, either. I would feel sad and guilty and be sent to jail where I would feel even more sad and guilty. Also, children are a lot smarter then they let on and very sensible even if it's in a way that's only sensible to them. When I used to work in Chipotle, parents would come in with their children. These children would run around the table, scream at each other, and leave rice and ground cheese on the floor. They would grab cups and not say please. When I swept the floor or picked up the cups, I would make up different children and hit them. Sometimes, these pretend children would end up dead. Their pretend parents would be very relieved. They would say, \"Our pretend child went to pretend school and teased weaker, smaller pretend children that looked a lot like you. Killing that child on your part was poetic justice. Good job.\" Then my Chipotle manager in real life would say, \"Why are you smiling while sweeping? That's pretty weird. Are you laughing at something? Are you laughing at me?\" If I ever kill pretend children again, I will see if their blood is another color besides red. Ellen Kennedy sounds like she knows what she's talking about. I once saw Starry Night when I was in New York. I would like to make a copy of it but with more blue paint. Maybe I could make the cypress tree in the foreground a Chipotle. - Gillian / March 1, 2009 9:10 PM i like this book - ryan manning / March 20, 2009 8:21 PM Yes! - Rose / April 2, 2009 3:44 PM good job. - johnny / April 21, 2009 9:46 PM Dude, woah, this drama between \"Nothing Ellen\" and \"DH\" and \"Sean\" is like it's own fuckin' book. I was googling myself and came across my comment from a long time ago. I was googling myself with the word fuck attached. A writer I respect had concerns and wanted to make sure I wasn't ever going to say I'd like to fuck her. - P. H. Madore / May 5, 2009 6:10 PM Ellen Kennedy is a person. She makes poems about stuff. She sliced-up avocados. She stands on her lawn and pretends she's the Lincoln Memorial. She transforms into a blue gelatinous substance and merges with passing joggers. - John / May 11, 2009 8:30 AM this is great. i would buy yr book but i dont have money. $$$ - simon / February 17, 2010 2:57 PM i like this a lot does everybody know everybody on this blurb i hope not i am foreign the way this is written reminds me of apples - joy / March 9, 2010 12:18 AM what seems more comfortable to you? laying in big sur, or laying in the lovely nests of hypertext ya'll make? - m.a. / May 27, 2010 9:24 AM I read your poem and smiled :) - Spongyhamster / July 17, 2010 9:29 AM yer poems are great, deepening. sat outside a movie theater for 30 minutes comfortably thinking abt a single poem. the one with the hamster that feels bad and opens in a shower. it was good i had that to think abt. - yes, you / July 29, 2010 9:33 PM yeaah, I read and imagined all stories mahtavaa! - serj kirchano / November 30, 2010 1:35 PM . - anonymous / June 7, 2011 5:47 PM you are nurishing to me. please write more.. - anonymous / July 27, 2011 4:03 PM"

Tao Lin is the author of ten books, including TRIP: PSYCHEDELICS, ALIENATION, AND CHANGE and LEAVE SOCIETY, which is forthcoming in 2021 from Vintage Books. He edits Muumuu House. His website is at taolin.us and he has a Twitter account and a blog. blurbs I have a relationship with this e-book. It is good in a way that makes me a little bit angry. I read it and say \"Dammit, why are you so hilarious and true?\" In order to know what the e-book says back to me, read it. - Rosie / March 12, 2006 10:13 PM My book makes me feel like lips eating itself. That's a lorrie moore quote. She has a story where she says something is like lips eating itself. Uh, this isn't a good feeling at all. - Tao Lin / March 16, 2006 5:03 PM Contrary to what was said above, The Establishment does like this wonderful book. We endorse it wholeheartedly. Tao Lin is loved by The Establishment. Don't be fooled by anyone saying different. The Establishment is not that dumb as to not like this wonderful book. We view Tao Lin as one of us, a brother, a true member of The Establishment. But people who are anti-Establishment will also like this book. It appeals to everyone, whatever their view of The Establishment. - The Establishment / March 16, 2006 5:50 PM An auspicious debut. I hope I spelled \"auspicious\" right. - Pete / March 16, 2006 5:54 PM A good time was had by all. Sometimes everyone feels like the bear. - Nick / March 17, 2006 12:27 AM Tao Lin wrote a book, I guess. - Matthew / March 17, 2006 12:54 AM What I liked most about this book was the finely crafted boat and sea poems. Tao Lin gives the reader what the reader always didn't know the reader wanted not not wanting and already had having wanted it in the backseat of a minivan. - Logan / March 17, 2006 11:50 AM This is a blurb for the blurbs people have written. The blurbs for my book make me want to run through the streets shouting, 'I have blurbs! I have blurbs!' I would never run shouting through the streets. It doesn't make sense. - Tao Lin / March 17, 2006 3:35 PM To be a good person, you can only sleep like four or five hours. Tao's poetry sleeps so few hours it turns into anti-sleep, which is a sleep like wet spiderwebs, a sleep like radioactive socks. Tao's poetry is a good person. Most people aren't good, and most people approve of sleep and soda, both of which are ultimately death. Mike - Mike / March 17, 2006 5:35 PM \"POWERFUL!!!\" - Gene / March 21, 2006 10:16 PM when i read tao lin's e-book it makes me feel like an out-of-control asshole. when i blurb his e-book it makes me think about how many books james tate has blurbed and wonder if he gets paid to do it and wonder why i'm blurbing tao lin's e-book when he'll never pay me any money to do it and instead keep asking me to send him money orders for $200. but i don't live in new york so i don't care if he's poor because i'm busy being poor on the other side of this country. then i read another poem from tao lin's e-book and think again about james tate's blurbs on books and remember when i used to sell milk to james tate every monday night when i lived somewhere else where i was poor. i'm the kind of person who occasionally name drops people like james tate because it makes me feel better about myself and lets people know that i am literate. i am literate. that's why i'm blurbing tao lin's e-book. i'm out-of-control and kind of an asshole. - Carla / March 24, 2006 3:45 PM What the christ? How dare you publish something this funny? How. Fucking. Dare. You? YOU. Experimental in a way that brings product, easy on the mind and on the clock, this has everything that makes for a \"little e-book\" and stunning at that. In a word, ridiculouslyawesome&worthyofallthatiscool. - P. H.

I mean Tao Lin. I like Tao Lin. I like toilets too, but they don't write poems. Tao Lin writes poems. They are pretty okay. I like them. Toilets do not write good poems. In fact they do not write poems at all, unless you think \"fluuuuuuuuuush\" is a poem. Or \"kachunk kachunk kachunk\" if you used too much toilet paper. Tao Lin is not a toilet. I am not a toilet. You might be a toilet. Or you might not be a toilet, how should I know. I just posted a comment about toilets. - John / April 30, 2009 11:20 PM i read this book whenever i feel very sad - chael / August 1, 2009 10:21 PM sometimes i enjoy reading ,when i lose myself in text,this is only sometimes - tim / September 10, 2009 5:30 AM damn, didnt know i could leave blurbs do you know the most efficient spacing of resistive copper-nickle alloy wire in a car's rear window defroster? im working on it but i seriously feel that tao's poems could solve this engineering design problem given the proper constraints and 11 hours of uninterrupted time and a good supply of organic trail mix with lots of dried cherries and not too many peanuts but i could be wrong - aw, fukk / October 21, 2009 4:16 AM i just deleted my blurb i still want to kill the hamster i want to shove a $200,000 house down his throat show my middle finger to his mother his mother will delete my blurb - JonB / March 28, 2010 6:46 PM my cock is beautiful - jonny / June 23, 2010 6:13 PM Hello, today I wrote something on a bench somewhere.

    "text": "Richie Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > Richie Thursday night they kidnap me, my mom, and my dad. They put garbage bags over our heads and push us outside. Inside the garbage bag I think about my American History teacher. I think about what he said to me. He said, Richie, you better speak up, you better talk in class, be more confident. I think about what I do every day. How I slept the entire Summer vacation. I think about how much more I will sleep in my life. I think how I don’t like anything. How I don’t have anything. I think that something might be happening finally. Something other than school or sleep. I’m kicked in the back. I fall to the ground. I’m pulled up. I put my arms out, sweep them around. I touch someone’s face. I hear my dad’s voice. He makes a noise. I hear my mom. She says, Richie, it’s okay, just listen to these nice young men. We’re pushed into a van or something. I hear one of the kidnappers. I know the voice. It’s a boy from school. He says, Drive. The van starts. I say, I can’t breathe. The garbage bag sticks to my face. It gets humid. Someone rips a hole in my bag, scratches my lips. I feel my skin hanging off. I think I’m bleeding. But now there’s a hole in the bag, near my mouth, and I breathe through it. I look out it. I see my feet. We’re in some kind of underground base. The walls are gray. We’re tied up, hands behind our backs. We’re tied in chairs. Side by side by side. My mom, me, my dad. Our necks are not tied. I glance at my mom. She says, Please don’t panic. I look at my dad. His face is intense, furious. He shakes his head. Slow and deliberate. He opens his mouth. But he doesn’t say anything. From behind us the kidnappers put garbage bags over our heads. My mom says, Thank you. I stay silent. My dad stays silent. I hear footsteps. The kidnappers walk in front of us. One of them says, There’s been a mistake. He says, We meant to kidnap only two of you but we kidnapped all three of you. He says, We need to release one of you. He says, After we release one of you, that one, whoever it is, will be sent a ransom note. He says, But we aren’t stupid. I hear coughs, murmurs. He says, We know if we release one of you then that one, whoever it is, will go to the police. He says, We don’t know what to do yet, we’re busy. He says, We have homework, we have to prepare our college applications. He says, We’ll keep you three down here until we have time to figure out what we should do. Another voice says, We have girlfriends. Another voice says, The first rule of fight club is. I hear someone being slapped in the head. I hear many kidnappers fighting, jumping on each other, rolling on the ground. I think about what if I was one of them. Playing, having fun. I think in my head that I wish I were one of them. My mom says, Don’t worry, Richie. The garbage bag sticks to my face. I writhe my neck. I bite the garbage bag. I bite a small hole out. I breathe in a scrap of garbage bag. I cough. I keep coughing. My mom says, Richie, what’s happening, what’s wrong? A week passes. We’re moved to another location. We’re put in a cage. There’s a bathroom here, and a kitchen. Each day we are let out of the cage for one hour. To eat, use the bathroom. A group of kidnappers come down, let us out, come back in an hour, lock us up. Every day my dad is more still. His eyes do not move. His eyeballs are unmoving and unfocused. Every day the silence is worse. My mom tells me not to worry. She says, Richie, don’t worry. But that is all she says. And she has been saying it less each day. My mom and my dad do not talk to each other. They are angry with each other. They don’t talk. They never did. But there was always some place to go. Another room. Now there is no place to go. They don’t talk. They are angry. I close my eyes, try to sleep. Every day I try to sleep. I try to stop my brain. I try to stop it from working. I dream I’m in American History class. The teacher calls on me. He says, How many Japanese were killed in the war? I don’t know what war he’s talking about. I say, Ten thousand. He says, What? What did you say? Speak up. I say, What war? He moves closer, like a monster. Everyone in class increases in size. I say, What, what war. I stutter. He says, What? I can’t hear you. I start crying. Everyone laughs at me. I wake up. I am not crying. My heart is beating very fast. I am in one corner. My mom is in another corner. My dad is in another corner. In the fourth corner there is no one. I stare at the fourth corner. My dad says, I’m worth $7,000 a day. It is the first time he has talked since the kidnapping. He says, I’m worth $291.60 an hour. He says, I can’t stay here, I’m worth too much. He says, I have to escape. My mom stares at my dad. My dad stares somewhere else. I stare at the ground. I try to keep my hands from tremoring. My neck is stiff. After a long time my mom says, You’ve been sitting there this entire time calculating in your head, haven’t you? My mom says, You never cared. My mom says, You never cared about me or Richie, just your money, your business. My dad says, I’m worth $4.86 a minute. He says, I need to escape. My mom is quiet. I don’t look at anyone. I go to the corner. I look at the corner of the cage. I stare until it’s blurry. The kidnappers come to let us out for our daily hour. They have masks over their faces. They come to our cage. They put garbage bags over our heads. I hear my dad scream. He screams a primal scream. I hear the kidnappers falling to the ground. I hear my dad scream, You motherfucking kids. I hear people being punched. I hear my dad running up steps. I hear the kidnappers screaming. One screams, What the fuck? One screams, Holy shit. I hear the kidnappers on the ground, groaning. I hear a door slam. I feel my heart beating. Two weeks pass. The kidnappers begin to let me and my mom out for up to five hours a day. My mom is not so angry anymore. But sometimes she is angry. She sits there and her face gets very tense. Her brows angle. When she is sleeping her face gets like she’s fighting a war. But sometimes she hugs me. She smiles. She asks how my life is. I say, Good. I say, Fine. But now she asks me again. She says, Richie, tell me about yourself. I look at her. I say, I don’t know. I say, I’m okay. She comes to me. She hugs me. She says, Richie, please, tell me how you really are, what your life is like. I stare at the ground. I open my mouth. Air goes in my mouth. I close my mouth. She hugs me closer. I say, I don’t know what is wrong with me. I say, It gets worse every day. My neck shakes a little. I say, I don’t know. My face twitches. She unhugs me and looks at me. I look at the ground. She hugs me. She says, Richie. She cries. I think, I shouldn’t have said anything. I think, What can she do about this? Sorry, I think. More days pass. My mom doesn’t look angry anymore. Sometimes when asleep she cries very quietly. Her face is calm. When she wakes she wipes the tears. She looks at me. She smiles. I look at her. I think about smiling. I try to smile. But I can’t. I don’t know how. I feel strange. I look at the floor of the cage. I lie down. I go to sleep. Today my mom wakes me. I sit up. She says, I remember when you were born. She says, I remember what your dad said to me. She says, After you were born your dad said, I’m very tired, I’m going home to sleep. She says, He never asked how I was. She says, He never asked if I was tired, if I was okay. She says, I was in labor more than 20 hours and he never asked how I was. She says, This is what I remember out of everything. She says, Richie. She says, I’m sorry, I’m sorry for telling you this. I look at her. She looks at me, starts crying. I look at the ground. I think about my life. I think about sleeping in class. I think about sleeping at home. I think about people. I start crying. She hugs me. She starts to say something, then stops. The kidnappers come down. They don’t wear masks anymore. I recognize one from school. I wipe my tears. I’m embarrassed. The kidnapper comes to the cage. He says, Hey, Richie. I look down. I wipe tears from my face. He says, We think we’re going to let you two go. He says, Your dad is gone, he went to Europe or something, he didn’t call the police. He says, But you two have to promise not to call the police. He says, We made a contract for you both to sign. I stare at the ground. My mom is silent. He says, Here’s the contract. I hear paper rustling into the cage. He says, Hey, do you want to leave or not? He says, Richie, hey, Richie’s mom, you two want to go back to the world or not?"

    "title": "Driveway",
    "text": "Driveway < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > Driveway I’m home from college. It’s 3 a.m. or something. I’ve been watching movies on television. It’s very dark out. I’m walking through the house. My mom’s asleep. My brother’s asleep. My dad’s asleep. Our house is big. I try not to make any noise. All the lights are off. The dogs are sleeping too. There’s a night-light by the stairs. It’s on. I sleep upstairs in the room above the garage. It’s quiet. I don’t want to wake anyone. I don’t make any noise as I go up the stairs. It’s very dark. My door is closed. I open it. I can’t sleep. I’m lying on my bed. I’m thinking how there’s no way out of anything. The pillow is too hard. I’m looking at the clock across the room on the computer desk. Its green numbers change to 4:25. I stand beside my bed. It’s dark. My body is exposed. There are three windows to this room. I don’t know if something will come at me. All this dark area on my chest and legs that I can’t see if anything’s there. I run a little to the light. My heart is beating very fast. I turn on the light and turn around. There is nothing in my room. Besides my bed and all that stuff. The ceiling fan is not on. On the ground are lingerie catalogues from earlier. It’s around 4:45 a.m. I’m looking out the window at the reservoir across the street. I’m looking at the moon, up and to the right. It’s a stone, glowing, drifting away. I look for clouds. I see stars. A plane. The street is somewhat lit. There are streetlamps. I’ve been home two days. There is still the Summer ahead, like a beach or parking lot. It’s 5:10 and I’m at the other window, which overlooks the driveway. I’m putting my head out the window. I twist my torso out and I sit, facing my room, on the sill. There’s the roof out here. I can climb up maybe. I’m standing on the sill, holding the top corners of the window. I’m trying to reach the ledge of the roof. I can’t sleep. I need to be on the roof. I’m moving my foot to the side frame of the window to try and leverage myself up. I’m almost there. I have two fingers touching a shingle of the roof. The shingles are like a dog’s tongue. I’m falling. I’m trying to use my hands to pull my head and neck and body up, but there’s only air. The top of my head hits the driveway. It makes a noise like an egg cracking. The sun’s coming up somewhere. I can see the ceiling of my room from here. The lights are on inside. I didn’t turn them off. I’m in pain. I think what hurts is my head. I can’t move my legs. I think I can move my hands but I’m not sure. They feel numb. But if they feel numb that means I can feel them. I don’t know what this means. I hear a car on the road. Birds are chirping. I’m on the driveway. Something walks by on my left. A lizard. What hurts most is a patch on the top of my head. I can feel the hairs sticking out like toothpicks. My blood feels warm. I imagine a dark red pool around my head. I hear silverware in the house. The dogs are barking. Someone opens the window by the front door. My brother says something. He says the word omelet. The television is on. It’s CNN. I think I feel a little hungry. My contact lenses are getting dry. I close my eyes. I see a dark orange light. The sun is steep behind my head. I feel tired. It feels like there are large grapes inside of my eyeballs. I’m falling asleep. The driveway is very hard. It feels good. I wake to a rumbling noise. I don’t know where I am. I’m thinking there are classes to go to. Is there a Chinese test today? Is it Monday? I see the sky and some of a house. I remember I’m at home. But what room? There’s a cloud above that looks like a steak. I remember falling from the window. The rumbling noise is a car. I can’t raise my head to see what’s coming. I see a blue curve of my mom’s minivan coming out of the garage. It’s coming very close to me. It’s going to run over my legs. I feel a pull in my neck, at the back of my scalp, by my left ear. My body moves a little. The minivan goes into the street. I listen until it’s gone. Everything is very quiet. I wonder about my leg. I remember how I was watching The Rules of Attraction on TV last night. I was doing sit-ups on the carpet. I did push-ups with my back straight and my head up, like the Sphinx. I was drinking green tea and eating purple grapes. I wonder where I’ll be in ten hours. Ten days. A year. I’m thinking this isn’t so bad. Forty or sixty more years. Then it’s over. There are hours like this, like parts of a day, and then there are years. Things can pass. They can go by quietly when you aren’t doing anything. Nothing can happen. It’s okay. It’s not so bad. I see a body in the window of my room. The body is blurry. My contact lenses are dry again. I wonder if they’ll slide to the backs of my eyeballs. I hear my brother’s voice. It says, Shit, Mom. His voice sounds very quiet but I know he is shouting. I try to say something. I feel a small pressure in the back of my throat. I don’t really hurt anymore. I can’t feel anything. I wonder about this. If I can’t feel anything am I paralyzed? If I’m paralyzed how can I feel that I’m not feeling anything? Mom, says my brother. I’m trying to concentrate on the part of myself where there’s the feeling of not being able to feel. I can’t focus anywhere. It feels like the sky is pressing out from my insides. There’s just a numbness everywhere. I think I can feel the driveway, like another leg or body, another unfeeling part of me."

    "text": "Go To the Beach < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > Go To the Beach Dana and I come home from groceries; my mother—a surprise—is asleep on the sofa. It’s Thanksgiving. A few weeks pass. “I feel afraid,” Dana says in bed. “You are quieter than before,” I say, “The last couple of weeks you’ve gotten quieter, more depressed, and I think more nervous.” “I’m tired,” she says. “Your head feels warm,” I think and say at the same time. My mother buys a 50-gallon fish tank—snails, crabs, suckers; no real fish—after New Year’s loses interest, and flies back to California. It’s Summer, Sunday morning; the phone is ringing. “Get it,” Dana shouts from the TV room. “I’m not moving.” “I’m coming to Tampa International Airport,” says my mother on the answering machine. “The wrong airport. I know. I don’t know. I’m here. Gate 84, Delta. See you soon, because I need you to pick me up. If you don’t I’ll fly back, since I don’t like Florida, which you know.” Dana comes in the bedroom; I push the delete button. “You just deleted a message so that I wouldn’t hear it,” she says. “That’s bad.” “My mom is at Tampa International Airport,” I say. “We live in Orlando,” Dana says. I stand up. I stare at a wall for a very long time without thinking anything, feeling anything, or blinking. Then I notice Dana standing in the doorway with a steak knife—blade tucked behind her wrist. She raises it, like to stab, and walks toward me; I side step, turn around; she stabs the knife into the wall behind me. “I’m serious,” she says. “I will kill everyone. It doesn’t matter.” With Dana listening on the line in the TV room, I call my mother’s cell phone. “How’s Dana?” my mother says. “Good,” I say. “Can you be more specific?” “Pretty good.” We say bye; my mother hangs up; I stay on. “Dana,” I say. “I’m depressed,” she says. “Hold me. I am very depressed.” “You are a person,” I say. “I want a sugar cookie,” she says. “I want a sugar cookie. I want a sugar cookie. I want a sugar cookie. I want a sugar cookie. I want a sugar cookie. I want a sugar cookie. I want a sugar cookie.” “Remember what your father said about dogs?” says my mother in the car on the way home from the airport. “He said dogs are people too,” she says. “Then stop eating animals,” I say. “I should not fly here like this,” she says. “It’s crazy. I am insane. Not because of this. I just feel insane all the time. Do you believe me?” “No you don’t,” I say. There is a Radisson Hotel. “Radisson Hotel,” I say. “McDonald’s,” I say. At a stoplight a man in the adjacent car uses both hands to eat from a large bag of chips. “I really, really approve of that,” I think. I make my window go down. Then I make my window go up. My mother quickly goes into the guest room. I carry in her luggage; she’s on the bed with her eyes closed. Dana is lying on her side on the carpet in our bedroom. She stares at me. I walk there—staring at her—lie facing her on the floor, and stare at her. “What are you doing?” she says. “Let’s see a movie,” I say. The movie theatre is inside a mall. There’s apathy about which movie to see; finally Dana quietly says the name of a movie aloud—by accident I think—and I say I want to see it. We have thirty minutes; we pick a direction and walk. “I feel strange,” I say. “I feel like a beach monster,” says Dana. “Beach monster,” says my mother. “What’s that? A fat person?” “I saw it in a book,” I say. “We saw it in a book.” At the entrance to Sears we turn around. A few stores later my mother taps my shoulder; we make eye contact. “Uh, do you want ice cream?” I say. She does. I ask Dana; she also wants ice cream. We get ice cream. During the trailers my mother leans over. “I feel deranged,” she says. “Test me. Ask me what were the last five presidents.” “I don’t know the answer to that,” I say. “Ask me something pragmatic,” she says. “After the interminably melodramatic Hollywood movie,” I think. “After the movie,” I say. For some reason we are sitting in the front row; during dialogue I move my neck to see who is speaking. Dana laughs at things that I cannot be sure are actually funny, since I also cannot, anymore, at this time in my life, actually comprehend the things that are happening, outside, in the world. My mother sleeps; except once she wakes, listens to a one-liner, laughs—when she laughs I laugh too—and goes back to sleep, smiling a little. I start worrying about things. Different things. I don’t know. I can’t focus on anything to worry about it. This worries me. Where do I work? What do I do for money? I can’t remember. I feel good. I feel great. The movie ends; my mother goes in the bathroom. Dana and I hold each other. I think she is saying something. “Did you just say something?” I say. “Did I just say something?” she says. “Probably.” “Maybe,” I say. “Your mom is taking a long time,” she says. “Fuck your mom.” “I’m bored,” I say. “Are you bored of me?” She holds my hand, starts walking; there’s an unmanned concession counter where it’s dark and quiet, and Dana takes us there; we climb over the counter, go through a door, then climb a ladder onto the roof. We are on the roof. “I want these motherfucking snakes off this motherfucking plane,” I say. It’s something I read off the Internet."

    "title": "Should",
    "text": "Should < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > Should There was a hole in his air mattress and he taped about half the mattress but the hole was not covered. At night he woke every four hours when the mattress deflated and he had to push a button to make more air go in. It made him know his dreams but in the morning he never remembered anything. He put up a thing in the laundry room that said he would buy a real mattress for thirty-five dollars and someone called and he went. “It’s two mattresses,” the woman said. “I’ve just been sleeping on both. It’s two on top of the box spring.” “Three mattresses,” he said. “How much for two? I forget what I put. On the paper.” She hesitated. “Thirty-five,” she said. “You can have the third free,” she said. He thought about it. The third was longer. “I want those two,” he said. The first night with the real mattress he slept five hours and woke very awake. He was happy about the new mattress. One night he was reading and his roommate knocked. “Come in,” he said. His roommate opened the door and laughed. “I have to lie on my back in bed to read,” he said. “I have no table. Or chair.” “Your room is kind of scary,” said his roommate. His roommate’s room was bigger. It had a queen-sized bed, two large windows, a stereo, a wall-length bookcase, two dressers, a chair, an oriental carpet, and three different kinds of lights. One night after showering he walked back to his room and saw broken glass. The light from the ceiling had fallen. “It could have killed me,” he said to his roommate. “I heard it,” his roommate said. “I thought it was something else. You dropped something or something.” The room was brighter without the glass covering for the ceiling light and he liked that. He had no job. He had a temporary job at the library but that was over. One day he went to the library for his check. The checks took four weeks to be processed. “This better be over five hundred dollars,” he said. “Oh,” said his supervisor. “Is it?” “I’m opening it,” he said “It’s like four hundred and ninety-nine,” he said. “Oh, good,” said his supervisor. He deposited the check and had two-thousand-dollars. His rent was due in a few days and then he would have about twelve-hundred-dollars. He met someone. After they had dinner together a few times they were on her bed. “Do you think I’m weird?” she said. He said she was not. He asked about himself and she said, “You’re not like a lot of other people. You say ‘what’s that?’” “For what?” he said. “When?” “You point at food and ask what the food is,” she said. “You ask questions.” On a different night she asked if he thought she was pretty and he said she was. “You haven’t told me,” she said. “You’re pretty,” he said. She laughed a little. “Thanks,” she said. On the night that she also said they should not see each other until the weekend she was crying a little and she said, “I’m sorry I’m sad.” “You’re not fat,” he said. “Why do you think I think you’re fat?” He was holding her from behind on her bed and they hadn’t had sex at this point and would not, even in the future, and she smiled—he saw the side of her face over her shoulder—and said, “Sad. I said ‘I’m sorry I’m sad.’” Later that night he sucked on her nipples a little then stopped. They lay there a while. She sat and he looked at her. He sat. He asked what she was thinking and she said she liked him but they didn’t communicate physically. For a while he had thought that she was too beautiful to really like him. He had black hair. Hers was brown. He was about one inch taller. She weighed more. He was skinny. Her apartment had three rooms. A room, the bedroom, the kitchen. In the kitchen was a dining table, a refrigerator, and a fish tank. One night they were standing in the doorway to her bedroom and she poked him and said he was skinnier than she was and he poked her and then she went in her bedroom and lay on the bed. She wanted him to read a story to her. “I can’t read,” he said. “It has exclamation marks. I can’t do exclamation marks.” “When I talk out loud I get tired,” he said. “My mouth. I won’t be able to finish.” A few nights later she said they did not communicate physically and he went home and read fifty-pages of a non-fiction thriller book and then cried a little while listening to music in bed. In the morning he felt sad. The night she said they did not communicate physically they were on her bed and he was listening to the sounds outside her window. The city noises were quiet and it made him remember when he was a child lying half-asleep on the sofa listening to the rest of house. “Why are you sad?” he said. She said she would not feel sad if she did not have to and he understood what she was saying, though she said it in different words. “Because I should,” she said. He thought it was a very good way to say it. He did not say that he was also sad because though he was sad generally he was happy that she liked him and that he liked her. A little later they were holding one another and eventually she took off her shirt and bra. He was licking her nipples and she was moaning and when he tried to take off her jeans she moved his hand away. She said she hadn’t had sex for a long time. She apologized and they lay there a while. She sat and he sat and that was when she said that she liked him but they didn’t communicate physically. (A few weeks later there was one night when she said a lot of nice things to him. She said, “It’s good to see you,” and, “I like you,” and, “There’s no one else like you.” Later that night when they had most of their clothes off she said, “Do you want to fuck?” He said he did. She leaned back a little and got a condom from her dresser and he held it. He realized he was not aroused. He was concentrating on her and for some reason he was not aroused. Earlier he was but now he was not. He had two jobs now and had slept about twenty hours that week. “Wait,” he said. “I’m kind of sick.” She asked what he meant and she laughed a little. He thought it was the kind of laughter when you were happy and laughed at almost anything. ”I’m on Tylenol Flu. I can’t get hard when I’m on Tylenol Flu.” “Are you sure?” she said. The first time she invited him over after dinner she had said, “Do you want to come over to eat grapes?” He was twenty-two and she was twenty-five. He thought she was very mature and he liked that. He was surprised she asked him over because at the end of dinner they did not speak for a while and it had been a little uncomfortable.) The night she said they did not communicate physically he said, “I like the sounds outside your window. They make me feel really young.” That night she also said, “You just want me to climb on top of you and fuck you.” He said that was not what he wanted. He wanted to say that she just wanted him to take off her pants and lick her vagina. He liked when they held each other and listened to music and he wanted to say but would not, even in the future—another three or four weeks and then they did not really see each other again—that she was much more concerned with sex than he was. He wanted to say that because maybe then she would say she was not as concerned about sex as he thought she was. Then they would not have to worry about it so much. When he tried to take off her jeans she stopped him and said she hadn’t had sex for a really long time and was sorry. (A few nights before she had asked if he had sex before. He said he had. She said it didn’t seem like he wanted to. “Because I feel like you don’t want to,” he said. She said, “I don’t yet,” and made a noise—sometimes she made this noise—like she was happy.) After she said that they should not see each other until the weekend he said it looked like she was on drugs. “Are my eyes dilated?” she said. She was looking in the mirror on her dresser and her eyes were dilated and she thought it was strange and funny. He did not think anything was very funny because a few minutes earlier she had said that she did not want to see him until the weekend. (A few weeks later he took a rock from a restaurant’s koi pond—he said if someone tried to stop him he would punch them with the rock in the face, and she laughed—for her fish tank and she said, “Do you want to come put it in yourself?” They talked louder and faster after he said yes to that question. He had two jobs now and after he kissed her neck and pinched and rubbed her nipples for a while he felt with his fingers that she was wet and she said, “Do you want to fuck?” He said he did and she laughed a little and leaned back to get a condom from her dresser.) He got off the bed and went in the kitchen and she followed. “Now what?” he said. “Oh. We already said ‘now what.’” The kitchen was quiet and the only light was from the fish tank, which was below them on a little table against the wall. There were long silences between talking and they held each other more sometimes and sometimes kissed. “I don’t want to not see you again,” she said. “Before in this situation I just wouldn’t see the other person anymore,” she said. “Maybe I’m more mature. Or I just like you a lot. I’m in a bad mood tonight. I’m just in a bad mood.” He understood that she was saying something that meant something and so was a message but it sounded strange and more like a sound than a message and he felt a little confused. They had dinner one time at a Japanese restaurant and he did not finish his food. Outside they were walking and she quickly said, “Do you want to come over to eat grapes?” He said he did. The grapes were purple. After that they were purple again and the time after that they were purple and then they were green."

My brother was old. He was twenty-five. One day on the cruise we were on the top deck. “Where are my parents?” I said. “I’m supposed to have a mom and a dad.” My brother stared at me for a very long time. He picked me up and threw me in the ocean. I didn’t scream. I thought it must be normal to be thrown off a cruise ship. I was raised by dolphins. Fifteen years later I found my brother in America. I punched him in the face and he went blind. There was no blood. I stayed to see what he would do. “Is this even fair?” he said after a while. “You were raised by dolphins, but now I can’t even move freely through this world, where colors and shapes and facial expressions are so important—crucial, really.” “I liked being raised by dolphins,” I said. I stayed some more. I did not want to leave. I stared at my brother. He was blind. I wanted him to say, “People are looking for you because they love you.” I wanted him to say the names of those people and to describe those people and for that to never end. He was moving his hands in front of him. “I liked being raised by dolphins,” I said He came toward me with his arms in front. We hugged. I felt I was going to cry and he started strangling me. “I can’t see,” he said. I reached behind me and picked up a knife that was on a table and I stabbed him in the center of his heart. I took his corpse and dove into the ocean. Because of being raised by dolphins I could breathe underwater and dive very deep without rupturing my lungs. I dove to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. I put my brother’s corpse in a crevice in the Marianas Trench. I stared at his corpse. It became unjammed and floated up and a shark ate it. “Shark,” I said. “Come here.” I spoke in a language the dolphins had taught me. “Great white shark,” I said. “Come eat my head.” I swam at it and held its mouth and felt its teeth. The shark was annoyed. It kept its mouth shut and turned away. I felt tired."

    "text": "Christmas < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > Christmas When I was five I had very pointy legs. I didn’t have feet really. At the bottom of my legs it was just very pointy. Whenever I went outside I stabbed a dozen lizards by accident. It was always a dozen for some reason. At home my mom stacked the lizards up in the guest room. I was very sad and ashamed but I had to go outside each day for Vitamin D from the sun. In my room I used rocks to try to dull my legs but it always just sharpened them more and made them very shiny. I cried myself to sleep every night. Then one Christmas morning in the living room there was a man in full plate armor on a horse. I said, “Mom, what is that?” She was blushing and looking away. The man dismounted his horse. He had a special sheath that was two sheaths. “Get in here,” he said and came toward me. He was smiling. “This isn’t right,” I said. I backed up until I was against a wall. I felt that there was something wrapped around my head and I tore at it. When I saw that it was wrapping paper and a red bow I began to cry. And as I cried at how pointy my legs were and how unfair life was the man who was a medieval knight lifted me and put me inside his sheath."

    "text": "The Walking Wall < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > The Walking Wall The wall was our bathroom wall. It had wallpaper with little staplers on it that made me sad. The first day that the wall wasn’t there we didn’t say anything. My brother and I were not on good terms. The second day the wall was in the hallway, lengthwise, so that there were now two separate hallways that led to the bathroom, which, with only three walls now, opened to the backyard. On the way to the bathroom that night I saw my brother coming down the now very narrow hallway. He would have to pass me to get to our room, which we shared. We were still not on good terms, so when I kneeled to allow him to pass, by stepping over me, it was in a mean and impatient way. I thought, Why didn’t he use the left hallway? This is America, not the United Kingdom, I wanted to joke. But didn’t, since we were not on good terms. He climbed over me. I stayed on my hands and knees until I was sure he was in our room. Then I stood up. The third day I went into the bathroom and saw that the wall was in the backyard. My brother was trying to climb it. He had one foot on the toilet paper roll holder and one hand on a painting framed up top. The painting was of a cat and my brother drew it when he was four and it made me sad to look at it. He kept climbing. I called him stupid. Then the toilet paper roll holder broke off. He dangled there, holding on to the top of the wall. The painting fell. I kind of wanted to help him up and then climb the wall myself, but we were not on good terms, so instead I watched and called him names. Then the wall fell on him. I thought, Hey, wait. I kept thinking that. After a while the wall lifted itself upright and my brother was gone."

    "title": "Taipei, Taiwan",
    "text": "Taipei, Taiwan < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > Taipei, Taiwan After college Neil moved home to allow time for thinking. Neil’s mom said, “Neil, what are you going to do this summer?” She hugged Neil. Then she made pancakes. Neil suspected that she had had plastic surgery done on her face. “Good for her,” thought Neil. Though, really, it made him a little sad. There was talk of teaching English in Taiwan. Young people were leaving America to teach English in Asia. This is what the young people were doing these days. There was something in the air. “Teach English in Taiwan,” said the air. “Okay,” said Neil. “I mean, maybe.” In the afternoons Neil’s head would become very heavy and he would have to lie down. He spent entire afternoons looking through his old yearbooks. One morning Neil piled all his possessions in the front yard in the shape and size of a small barn. People drove by and bought things. “Make me an offer,” said Neil. “Sold,” said Neil. He liked saying that. Neil spent his yard-sale money on expensive coffees. After coffee Neil would go in his room and write longhand. After writing a poem he would feel pretentious and then become very sleepy. He took long, heady naps and woke up pessimistic about his future and disorientated but well rested and hungry. He began to get ideas. Not for stories or poems but for business plans and other things. One idea was that if extraterrestrials visited Earth they should land on the tops of hills. That way, upon leaving their UFOs, their jetlag and space malaise would be immediately mollified by the greenery and smoothness of the hill. “Write what you want to read,” thought Neil. “Teaching English will be a good experience for you,” said Neil’s mom. Neil became confused and bought a toy poodle. He had the idea that if your dog were small it should live inside the walls. If your dog weighed less than 10 pounds, then when you came home it should already be inside the walls, scurrying and making scratchy gerbil-noises. Neil thought, “It’s over. My life is over.” He liked to provoke his toy poodle. Push it around. Corner it and make faces at it. He tried to use his ideas for stories and poems. But his brain would say, “Neil, what are you doing?” One time Neil was eating a peach and his brain said, “Neil, what are you doing?” “You are the dog of the millennium,” Neil said to his dog. Then he pointed at it. Then he jumped over it. Neil’s mom arranged for Neil to live with his uncle Francis in Taiwan. She encouraged Neil to go outside, to join a gym, and to eat more. She made Neil smoothies with honey and soymilk. “I’m not sure if I want to go to Taiwan,” said Neil. “How will I talk to people?” He had thoughts of California, of driving there, and doing something. Driving around, looking at stuff. He’d do things. He had an image of himself and his toy poodle in Alaska, in a log cabin, fighting back hordes of bears with a peashooter. Taming the bears. Setting up a bear circus, or a bear slavery gang. Neil had been to Taiwan before to visit relatives. He spoke very little Mandarin. Between naps Neil snuffed his face into his pillow and said, “Aaaarrrghhhh.” He had difficulties in naming his dog. He didn’t want to be ironic or witty. He also didn’t want the dog to be named something like “Woofers” or “Woofy.” But he didn’t want to be overly calculated in naming his dog either, didn’t want it to take on an evil, cold-hearted tone, which it maybe already had. Neil put an ad in the paper to sell the dog. “Your plane leaves Friday,” said Neil’s mom. “I got you a window seat.” She recommended that Neil do push-ups in the privacy of his room. “There’s a smoothie in the refrigerator,” she said and smiled. Neil said, “Why did you buy me a ticket?” He slammed the door to his room. He yelled at the closed door, “I need to make my own choices for once.” His room had only his bed left, because he had sold all his possessions, and he sat on it. He was embarrassed about how immature he was. He thought that he should write about this, his embarrassment. And he tried. But the tone was immediately evocative of a boy band music video, one of the ones meant to be sad. So he wrote a story about a mailbox that could walk. It could fly, actually. One day, full of important mail, it rocketed out of the ground into outer space. “Ha, ha,” it said. “Suckers!” It flew around a while, became lonely, and smashed itself into a building. A man called about Neil’s dog. He came over. “I should first see how it gets along with my other dogs,” he said. Neil got in the man’s car and they drove to the man’s apartment. The man had three other dogs, all different sizes. He also had children. The children and the dogs moved very slowly near the walls. The apartment was dark and smoky and a purple light came from another room. “They get along great, wonderful,” said the man. One of the children was a tiny girl. She was in the corner, by the purple light. She had Starbursts and was slowly eating them. “Sold,” said Neil. The girl was lithe, Neil noticed. At home Neil masturbated to an older version of the Starbursts girl. “Eat this salad,” said Neil’s mom. She had prepared a salad for Neil. It had big pieces of green peppers and bacon in it. “I can make my own food,” said Neil. “I know you can,” said Neil’s mom. She touched Neil’s shoulder and Neil twisted away. “If I want to eat something I’ll make it myself from now on,” said Neil. He went into his room. He fell asleep and had a dream that the moon came very close to the Earth, and he said to himself, “The moon has gotten bigger over the years.” The moon came a little closer, and then a little closer, and then Neil was smooshed. Neil woke up and went back to sleep. He had a dream where a girl gave him so much eye contact that he loved her immediately. They were in a bookstore. Then they were in a cool, UFO-ish room. The girl kissed Neil from above. Her mouth was small and stormy. “Is she drunk?” thought Neil. “I hope she isn’t drunk.” When Neil woke it was almost dark out and he was sweating. He masturbated to the girl in his dream. It was the Starbursts girl. Was it the Starbursts girl? Neil went to the bathroom and washed his hands and face. In the mirror his face looked ugly. His bones were receded and doughy. “We are your bones and we don’t care,” said Neil’s bones. Neil showered, then slowly dried himself. The rest of the day became very small. It went into Neil’s bones and lay there, and made Neil very tired. “Neil,” said Neil’s mom. “I bought toothpaste and shampoo for your trip.” There were also soap and disposable razors. They were on the kitchen counter. An array of things, on top of a neatly folded blue towel. “Why do you have to do everything for me?” said Neil. He went back into his room. He tried to slam the door, but the air was thick. The door moved slowly against the air and then stopped moving. Neil pushed it a little and it closed. He became very vague in his thinking. His thoughts swam. They swam like animals that maybe could not swim. Kangaroos, cattle, armadillos. They struggled a little, sank, and then floated to the surface, bloated and upside-down. “Errffe eerfff ffff,” said the kangaroos while underwater. When Neil left his room his mom would give him karate dojo brochures. Neil suspected that how his face felt to him was how a zombie’s face felt to a zombie. He rented a zombie movie. In it the zombies had patchy skin and delinquent personality types. They made noises like, “Rrraagghraaaggh,” and said things like, “I want to eat your liver.” “Hollywood,” thought Neil. Maybe he would make his own zombie movie. Neil’s zombies would live quiet, solitary lives. They would have college degrees. They would brush their teeth twice a day with whitening toothpaste, and eat red pepper salads. They would be considerate of others. It would be a silent film. “Neil,” said Neil’s mom. He wrote a story about a man who had very good things happen to him. “The man was great. He was the happiest man ever, the best! Each day more good things happened to him, and it was great, and the best. The man was happy. The man lived forever and kept getting happier.” On the drive to the airport Neil sat in the backseat. He was angry. His mom had put some more items into his bag after he had already packed. “Don’t do anything for me again,” said Neil. “If you do one more thing for me I’m never talking to you again.” His mom was quiet in the front seat. Neil said, “If you didn’t spoil me so badly I might be able to do things myself.” He said, “I graduated college and look at me. I’m still yelling at you about this stupid crap. Isn’t this strange to you? Don’t you wish I were more mature?” He said, “How can I live and grow up if you do everything for me?” He said, “I don’t want you to call me in Taiwan.” Neil’s mom turned and looked at Neil and said, “I love you.” Neil slammed the car door and went in the airport without his bag. He felt sticky and hot in his head and chest. The airport was very crowded. “Every man, woman, or child in this airport is wandering around in a depraved way,” Neil thought. Uncle Francis met Neil at the airport in Taiwan. “Neil,” said Uncle Francis. His English was limited and unrefined, so he did not say anything more. “Hi,” said Neil. Uncle Francis had a daughter, Lisa, who was Neil’s age. Lisa had learned English in school. “Hi, Neil,” said Lisa. “How was the plane trip?” “Good,” said Neil. “It was a long plane ride,” said Lisa. “I hope you were comfortable.” Then there was a silence. When Neil talked again Lisa also talked, at the same time. Then they both stopped. Then they both talked again at the same time. Neil’s face turned red. He looked directly at the ground. He stayed in his room from then on. Uncle Francis had bought new sheets and pillows for Neil’s room. Neil’s mom did not call. Uncle Francis slipped brochures about teaching English under Neil’s door. The brochures were in Chinese. Neil knew that he would not teach English. He could not interact with one person. How could he instruct a class of them? Neil would sleep. He would sleep and destroy all desires and be satisfied with his life, in his room. Or else he would wallow and be regretful. He would wallow and be regretful. He wished his mom had stayed in Taiwan. Raised him here, native. He wished his mom had died early, leaving him to do things for himself. Neil wished for 10 percent increases in kindness, tolerance, social skills, confidence, and attractiveness and then felt cheated in life by 10 percent. A package came from Neil’s mom. Inside was Neil’s bag and another bag of toothbrushes, shampoo, and dental floss. Neil said in his head, “I knew it. I knew she would do this.” Neil’s brain said, “Now you’re going to get angry, aren’t you, Neil, you little shit.” He watched Chinese CNN on the TV in his room. He watched Taiwanese soap operas. He lay on the carpet and stared at the ceiling. Tried to stare through to the next floor. X-ray vision. Maybe Neil was a superhero and just didn’t know it. He locked his door. He did cartwheels and somersaults. He turned off the lights, stood facing into a corner, and laughed. He felt afraid. There would be no epiphanies, ever, he knew, nothing. There would be a near-endless series of embarrassing moments. There would be that. He masturbated repeatedly to the Starbursts girl. He masturbated quietly, with a neutral facial expression. When Uncle Francis or Lisa knocked on his door he would pretend he was asleep or else hurry into the bathroom and turn on the shower. “Pshaw,” said the showerhead. At night Neil snuck into the kitchen, like a burglar. But mostly Neil just slept. The traffic in the streets sometimes woke up. The Taiwanese traffic. The apartment was in Taipei, the capital city. “I am in the capital of the universe,” thought Neil. Then he put his face into his pillow and said, “Arrrrrrngggg.” Neil’s mom called. “Neil, how are you,” said Neil’s mom. She talked softly. She stuttered a little between “Neil” and “how.” “Did Uncle Francis tell you how to get started?” said Neil’s mom. Neil tried to be happy and not at all angry. He did not say anything, not yet. “How are you? Neil?” said Neil’s mom. “I miss you.” “Why did you send my bag?” said Neil. “Why did you send all that shampoo and dental floss? Would it kill me to have to go outside and buy shampoo by myself?” He said, “Why did you have to do that?” He said, “I can never escape from you. You don’t know how this feels. I can’t make my own mistakes. I can’t learn. You do everything for me.” He said, “I can’t live. I can’t be alive.” Neil said in his head to himself, “You are a cloying motherfucker. What the fuck are you talking about? You are a terrible piece of shit.” Neil’s mom said, “You’re an adult now and you need to do things yourself. I know that.” Neil said, “You always say that but you never change.” He said, “Didn’t I say I would never talk to you again if you did anything else for me?” Something bilious and gray in Neil’s head was beating like a pigeon. “Fuck,” Neil said in his head. He regretted everything that had happened and everything that would happen. He saw his mother on the other end with a worried look on her face and then he hung up the phone. He would write about this. It would be miserable. There was a window and Neil thought about throwing the phone through it, the glass breaking. He thought about throwing himself out of it. “Ridiculous,” he thought. He set the phone down on the receiver on the bed. He tried to be very un-melodramatic about this but the deliberateness of it made it enormously melodramatic. He sat on the bed. He knew it would be a long time before he would talk to his mother again. He thought that from now on he would be a nicer person. He would talk to Lisa and Uncle Francis and try very hard to be a normal, friendly person. “Yeah, right,” he thought. He stood and walked around with his arms out stiff in front. He went into the bathroom and looked at himself in the wall mirror. “Liver blood,” he said. “Rraarrgh, raagghh.”"

    "text": "Mistake < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > Mistake On the answering machine a man says a branch from my tree is in his backyard. He lives in the house behind mine and wants me to move my branch from his backyard. I knock on his door, no one’s home. I go around back. Yes, there is a branch, the size of a car, in his backyard, under a pine tree, which is his. I can see where the branch broke off his tree and fell in his backyard. The next day there’s another message. The man says he made a mistake. I listen to the message twice and feel that there is no mistake, that this is a scheme designed to trick me into doing work. My wife Janet comes in with our two kids, Thomas and Ryan. I am standing here not doing anything. I push the answering machine button again. Thomas starts talking about blue whales. Thomas is seven. The message is playing on the machine and Thomas is talking. “Be quiet a moment,” Janet says. She puts a hand on Thomas’ head. Ryan starts talking about something, I don’t know what. He’s complaining about something. Ryan is thirteen and a skateboarder. He has an annoyed look on his face. I remember seeing him laughing earlier with friends. “Ryan,” I say. “We’re trying to listen to the answering machine. Why are you complaining about your life while we are trying to listen to the answering machine?” Ryan goes to his room. Ryan is handsome and strong. Thomas is frail and uglier and has buckteeth. The message ends, Janet looks at me. She is standing by the sink. “How was it?” I say. “How was what?” she says. “I don’t know. Whatever you just did today.” Janet comes and pushes the play button. The message starts again. I think about Ryan and I feel anger towards Ryan. “I parked in the street,” Janet says. “There’s a branch in our driveway. Did you see that?” “Yeah,” I say. “I saw it.” “Why didn’t you move it?” “I didn’t see it,” I say. “I didn’t lie. I mean, I think I saw it. I was distracted. I was going to move it.” Janet starts walking to the front door. “I’ll move it,” I say. I walk quickly past her. “I was going to move it but you came in.” In the driveway is a very large branch. Janet’s car is parked in the street. I see that my own car is also parked in the street. I don’t remember parking in the street. I don’t remember this branch, which looks the same as the branch in the man’s backyard. I get in my car and drive around the neighborhood. I want to knock down mailboxes, but am able to control myself, which makes me think about discipline and statistics, which makes me think about video games. Zelda, Dragon Warrior. Maybe I’ll buy a Nintendo. I drive back to the house and park in the street. I think that I’ll watch TV before I move the branch. Janet is washing dishes. I kiss her cheek and smile. She doesn’t look at me, her face is annoyed. I open the refrigerator. I pick up a tray of cheese cubes and close the refrigerator. Janet finishes the dishes, turns around, leans against the sink. She doesn’t look happy. I take a cheese cube and put the tray back in the refrigerator. I toss the cheese cube in my mouth but it hits my forehead and falls on the linoleum, which is sticky and brown. With my feet I push the cheese cube away from the dirty part of the floor. I am wearing socks. Janet is watching me. Thomas walks in. Thomas and Janet watch me bend, pick up the cheese cube, and eat it. I think about grinning. I feel tired. “Thomas, help unload the groceries,” Janet says. She is looking at me. “Move them to the sidewalk first. I’ll be right out.” “I’ll help,” I say. I get the feeling she’s already told me to unload the groceries. Like she told me to do it and I said I would but then didn’t. Something like that. I’m not sure. Thomas goes out to the garage. “Remember Nintendo?” I say. “We used to play.” Janet looks at me for a very long time. “Things better change,” she says. “Things should change. Soon.” “What do you mean?” I say. “Wait. What are you talking about?” “I’m talking about that things need to change.” “Oh,” I say. I ask if it was the cheese cube. “I shouldn’t have eaten it,” I say. “I know. But who knows? What’s wrong with eating that? Is it bad example for Thomas? That’s crazy. Wasting food is a bad example, not preserving food. No one gets sick from eating germs anyway. I mean eating stuff off the ground. The bacteria is healthy. It’s like yeast. Wheat germ.” I don’t understand what I’m talking about. “That’s a myth. That’s just an urban myth. To get you to buy more food.” “Ryan wants a basketball hoop installed in the driveway,” she says. “What are you going to do about that?” “Ryan doesn’t play basketball. He’s a skateboarder.” “What if he does,” Janet says. “Then what? He’s joining the basketball team. What are you going to do?” I look past her, at the back patio, the swimming pool. I focus on her. She has a banana. I look at the banana. She was washing dishes. Now she has a banana. I remember when Ryan was small and told a friend in an angry voice that he wished his dad were taller and better-looking. I remember when Ryan made fun of Thomas’ buckteeth and Thomas wouldn’t go to school or leave the house for a week. Janet shakes her head and goes into the living room. I go to the hallway off the kitchen. I get a belt from the closet and fold it once. Ryan’s door is locked. “Why is this door locked?” I say. I tell Ryan to let me in. He doesn’t say anything. “What do you need?” he says. “Scissors,” I say. Ryan opens the door and I push him and start hitting him. He is on his back on the carpet. He holds his hands in front and I hit him with the belt. He doesn’t have a shirt on and I don’t like that and I don’t know why I don’t like that. He turns away and I hit his shoulders and back. He screams. “Eeeeaaaahhh,” he says. Thomas is here, with a Nerf baseball bat. He holds the foam bat part and hits me with the plastic handle. I keep hitting Ryan. Thomas is crying and Ryan is screaming. Janet is in the hallway when I finish. I get in my car. I drive around. I drive to my friend Jon’s apartment. Last time I saw Jon he was washing dishes at The Olive Garden. He is watching The Little Mermaid on TV. The lights are off and the blinds are shut. He looks at me and says my name. I sit next to him on the sofa. He has a remote control and sometimes rewinds a scene and sometimes uses slow motion. He doesn’t say anything. It’s very dark and cool and I fall asleep. When I wake the heavyset octopus lady is singing. She swims and shoots ink while singing. When she is done the screen becomes very quiet. I hear the air conditioning go on. Jon turns the volume up. “Hook me up with a job,” he says. “I did it for you. Get me a job.” He puts the volume up some more. It is very loud. “When did you get me a job?” I say loudly. I say I’ll try. I tell him I’ll do it, I’ll hook him up. I start talking about Ryan. I don’t want to bother Jon while he’s watching The Little Mermaid, but he doesn’t seem to care, about anything. “I need to tell you something,” I say very loudly. I start talking about the groceries. How Janet was being passive-aggressive. I say something about the two branches. I don’t want to confuse him but I’m confused myself. He puts the volume up more. I can’t hear anything. “I hit Ryan with a belt again,” I scream. “I feel stupid.” I scream that I can’t understand people anymore, that I feel like a five-year-old, that I’m confused all the time. I look at Jon. His hair is oily. There is chocolate, or something, on his face. He puts the volume to maximum. My head hurts. We watch the scene where the crab is in the kitchen and the cook runs around. My ears are ringing when I get home. The bagged groceries are on the floor in the kitchen and I start putting them in the refrigerator. I’m not strategic about it and after three bags, with four left, there’s no space in the refrigerator. I go to the bedroom. The bathroom door is open. Janet is in the shower making strange noises. I open the glass door and turn off the shower. She has her clothes on and is flailing around. Her eyes are not focused. “Uh, what are you doing?” I say. She is hitting herself with a bar of soap. I go in and hold her. She moans and sometimes howls. She has a stroke-victim face. I carry her into the bedroom and put her on the bed. She kicks and punches the air above her. I stare at her. After a while she moves slower. She falls asleep. I lie down beside her. Everything is wet and soapy. There’s green shampoo in her hair and it smells good, but she doesn’t look pretty. I think about divorcing her. I think about lawyers. I might need one. I’ll need to fill out forms, mail things. It seems like too much work. I go to the living room. Ryan is on the sofa looking at me. I turn to go somewhere else then turn back and sit next to him on the sofa. I say there’s a new rule. He can’t lock his door. If he locks the door I’ll confiscate it. I turn on the TV. There’s a commercial about cat food. The family is laughing. It shows the cat’s face. It shows the family hugging. I think that Ryan can lock his door if he wants. It’s his room, not mine. I think that in the future if I want to beat him he should have his door locked and not let me in. I’m ready to say all this. I turn my head and look at him. He’s staring at me. His eyes are twitching a little. I think he’s going to cry and I go to hug him and he takes the remote control off the coffee table and throws it at the TV. It makes a dent in the wall. He looks at me. His eyes are wet. He says something about scissors and says some curse words. He flips the coffee table over. While flipping it over he says, “Raaaarrrggghhh!” He walks away. I hear the door to his room slam. Janet comes out of the bedroom and runs across the living room, into the kitchen. I hear crashing noises. She comes back in the living room. Her forearms are bleeding. She has a package of hot dogs. She dances in place, an angry dance. She runs away. The house is quiet. Then I hear the piano. The rhythm is off and the chords are a little wrong, but I can tell it’s the theme from Jurassic Park. Sometimes there is shrieking. The playing stops and Janet makes strange noises. Eventually she plays the entire theme and starts playing scales. I fall asleep on the sofa. Janet is in the swimming pool when I wake the next day. She has on her pharmacist’s coat and Walgreen’s nametag. She is wearing goggles, but one eyepiece is over her nose and the other is over her ear. She climbs out of the pool, says, “Rrrggggrrrgggggggg,” and picks up a towel. She has a disgusted look on her face that doesn’t change. She flails the towel at her body and the towel flings away and she runs toward the pool. When she gets to the water she keeps running and falls in. I go to work. In the parking lot my manager is leaned against his car, smoking. I ask if there are any job openings. I say my friend Jon needs a job. My manager says he’s been fired. “What? Who fired you?” I say. “How?” “They fired me,” he says. “Who?” I say. “I thought you owned it. You’re the owner.” “I am just fired and now you’re accosting me on all this technical shit. What the fuck are you doing? I just lost my job and you’re hassling me on technicalities.” I apologize. I say that something strange happened to my wife. “So what,” he says. “My wife turned strange like fifteen years ago. So you get married and your wife turns strange. So what. Why am I hearing this? What is this? The Young and the Restless? You wake one day, you don’t know anything. Your head is… it feels like a rock. You buy a pet fish, guinea pigs, and your fish throw themselves out of the fish tank and your guinea pigs eat each other. Tell me I’m pessimistic. Do it. I dare you.” “No,” I say. “Look,” he says. “All I’m saying is that shit—life is shitty. Shit comes out of your toilet. You go back and shit in the toilet. Twice a day. You know it. Doctors recommend it. You dig a hole in your yard. You put your fish and guinea pigs in. After a shitty day at work you drive your car into that hole. That’s how big you have to dig the hole. You know how big a car can get? Buy some rabbits. Take a piss and stay in the bathroom for a nap. Wipe your ass with the fake plant by the sink—” He is staring at me. He keeps talking. I start moving away from him. He stops talking. “I’m going to be late for work,” I say. “See,” he says. He points at me. “This is what I’m talking about.” He pushes the lit end of his cigarette into his arm. His face turns red and his neck tremors. “Nngggh,” he says. “Nnnaaarrrrrrrghhhhh!” I tell him I’ll put in a good word for him. I walk away. Inside, the phone is ringing but no one is answering. The pizza maker is going but there are no pizzas in it. Everyone is looking at the ground. I look at the ground too. The phone keeps ringing. I pick up the phone. Someone wants to know if there’s a special for one of everything. “I don’t know,” I say. “Wait.” I look at the charts on the walls. I feel tired. I hang up. Some workers take off their uniforms and leave. After a while it’s just me and a high school girl. We look at each other. I don’t know her name. She backs away and leaves. I go to Kmart. They don’t have Nintendo. I buy an old model used Game Boy. Outside it is very sunny. I fall asleep a little and almost drive into a school bus. At home Janet is lying on the carpet between the sofa and the overturned coffee table. She is a little bloated. The TV is on with menus on the screen. Janet is swinging the remote control in the direction of the TV. She sneezes. There is a bag of tortilla chips and a thing of salsa by her head. I sit on the sofa so that Janet is by my feet. I try to turn on my Game Boy. It has no batteries. The remote skims the top of my head and lands behind the sofa. Janet looks there and says, “Grrraaagggrraaaaaaaahhhg!” The doorbell rings and I go there. It’s a man I don’t know. I put my Game Boy on the carpet and open the door. We shake hands. “I’m from there,” he says. He tries to point over my house. I feel sleepy when I watch him do this. “I left messages on your machine,” he says. I tell him to come in. “Wait,” I say. “What do you want from me?” “I want to apologize,” he says. “I knew the branch wasn’t yours. Sorry. I was having a bad day. I thought I should come over and apologize.” I tell him it’s okay. I say I have a branch problem, too, in my driveway. I point there. I hear Janet moaning behind me and I turn. One side of her face is moving around but the other side is not, then both sides start moving and she pushes past me, past the man, and runs into the front yard, clawing at air. She is clawing at the air. “Hey,” I say loudly to the man, who is turned around looking at Janet. “What’s your name?” “That your wife?” he says. I squint into the front yard. Janet is by the mailbox, flailing her arms at it. She is shrieking a little. “That’s not my wife,” I say. “Who is that?” “Yeah, that’s my wife,” I say. “So what?” I ask him to come inside. “Do you want lemonade?” I say. “Nah,” he says. “No,” he says in a mock serious voice. He smiles. His teeth are very white and straight. “But you should come over,” he says. “Help me with the branch.” “The branch,” I say. He is smiling. “You should come help move the branch,” he says. “It’s not my branch,” I say. “I made a plan,” he says. He has papers. They look like blueprints. “But it’s going to take two men to do this.” I shut the door. He stands on my front porch for a long time then leaves. I open the door. He has rubber-banded one of his papers on my doorknob. “Plans,” the paper says. “Use a hammer to smash the branch. Carry the branch—” I turn the paper over. There’s a drawing of two men. One is on the patio, on a recliner, sipping a tropical drink and eating cantaloupe slices. The other is underneath a branch. There is blood on the man who is under the branch. I fold the paper until it’s small and hard. I put it in my pocket. “Janet,” I shout. She runs back in the house. She is sweating and has pieces of mail crumpled in her right hand. There is a mail in her hair. In the living room I turn the table upright. I get a plate, put salsa and chips on the plate, put the plate on the table. I sit on the sofa. Janet looks at the chips and salsa. She gets a sleepy look on her face. She drops the mail and throws herself on the table. She squirms on the table, belly down. Some salsa gets in her mouth and she howls. After a while she falls at my feet, between the sofa and the table. “Krraaarraaghh,” she says. I try to lift her but I feel tired and sit back down. I lean forward to pet her. She bites at my hand. There are chips and salsa on her face, which is bleeding a little. I lean back into the sofa. I look around at our TV and family photos. I look at the swimming pool. I stare at the swimming pool. It’s very sunny outside. I fall asleep a little, then hear the kitchen door shut and feet moving throughout the house. Ryan comes in the living room with his friend Eric, a group of small girls and boys who look about four-years-old, and Thomas. I see that Thomas and Ryan have shaved their heads on the sides and have blue Mohawks. Thomas has “666” written on his forehead in blue marker. They look at Janet. I look at them and they look at me. “There’s my dad who beats me,” Ryan says. “There’s my mom who’s a zombie. See?” he says to Eric. “Are you looking?” “She has a virus,” Eric says. “It’s a virus. That’s not a zombie. Zombies have stiff body movement. She’s faking.” “She is a zombie,” Thomas says. “Vampires and Frankenstein and Snakes are bad people,” says one of the small boys. “And zombies.” He makes a cross with his fingers and holds it toward Janet. Ryan looks at the small girls and boys. “Okay,” he says. “Pay me money.” The girls and boys hold out crumpled up bills toward Ryan. “Don’t,” Eric says. “Don’t pay him. She’s not a zombie.” Ryan pushes Eric. “What the fuck are you talking about?” Ryan says. Eric stumbles and recovers and stares at me. He has something in his shirt pocket. He squints at me. “Forget it,” he says. “You chumps are getting ripped off. Three-year old chumps.” Ryan takes the money puts it in his pocket. They look at me and Janet and I look back at them. I start thinking that I should get up soon to buy a hammer to smash the branch. I’ll need to call an ambulance for when I’m underneath the branch. There are two branches. I yawn and rub my eyes. Janet is at my feet. I can hear her sobbing. I think she’s sobbing. “She’s the living dead,” Thomas says. “The undead demon lord from on the other side of the River Styx.” He puts his hands on his head and claps at his Mohawk. “What’s its name?” says one of the girls. “Hell monster,” Thomas says. Eric puts his hand in his shirt pocket and takes something out. It’s my Game Boy. He tosses it from one hand to the other, then puts it back in his shirt pocket. “Swish,” he says. I yawn. My eyes fill with water. “There’s my dad who beats me,” Ryan says. He puts his arm around Thomas and points at me. “He beats me with a belt.” He looks at Eric and Eric nods."

    "text": "Robbers < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > Robbers There’s this noise that wakes me. It’s very late at night. I get up. There are two people by my dresser, stuffing my clothes into a garbage bag. I watch them a while. It’s a mother and a daughter. “What are you doing?” I say. The mother takes one of my sweaters, puts it to her body, then stuffs it in the garbage bag. They don’t say anything. They’re in my bedroom, taking my stuff. The garbage bag is getting really big, bulging on the ground. I think about this. I want to go back to sleep. “Okay,” I say. “Fine. Take the clothes. All of them, I don’t care.” I go to my bed to go back to sleep. But I notice someone on my back porch. It’s a man. It must be the husband, I think. This must be a family thing, I think. I go out there. He’s trying to lift my back porch table. The one I like. He’s spreading his arms out on it like a bird, trying to carry it like that. “Hey,” I say, “what’re you doing?” He says, “I’m trying to take this table.” I say, “You can’t have that.” He has it lifted a little when I say that. He drops it. It makes a noise. He stands there and I stand here. I think, a family of robbers. “Okay,” I say, “I’m going back to sleep.” In the bedroom the mother pulls a second garbage bag out of her pocket. The daughter is tying the first garbage bag with a twisty thing. I go to my bed and sleep. The next day I see the robber husband at the mall, in the parking lot. I run to him. “Hey,” he says. “Hey,” I say. I want to know how he knew my address. I’ve been thinking about this all day. “How did you get my address?” I say. He says, “I work for an information company, I know everyone’s address.” He pulls out his wallet, opens it, takes out two business cards. “See,” he says. I take the cards, look at them, run back to my car. That night I can’t stop laughing. I’m telling my husband and son what happened. “This guy is so stupid,” I say. “He’s a burglar and he robbed our house and he gave me two of his business cards. I know where he lives.” I’m at my dinner table, laughing. My husband is frantic, serious. He wants to know when the robbery happened and why I didn’t tell him and why I didn’t call the police and what was taken and what the robbers looked like and why I didn’t wake him. But I can’t stop laughing. I keep thinking that the robber gave me his business card. I turn to my son. “I know his name, phone number, everything,” I say. My son looks at me blankly. I can’t stop laughing. The next day I come home from the grocery store. I’m carrying two brown paper grocery bags. I notice someone on the back porch. It’s the robber who gave me two of his business cards. The information person. I run out there, carrying the bags. I’m annoyed. I trip a little and a thing of tomato sauce falls out of a bag and shatters on the floor. I keep going. I see he’s pulling my plants out. My little garden by my pool. He reaches down to get something. He has a shovel. He pushes it into my garden and lifts one of my flower plants. His wife comes in from the side screen door, holding a garbage bag. “Hey,” I yell, “you can’t have those.” I shift the groceries in my arms. I’m angry. The husband slides the flower plant from the shovel into the garbage bag. The daughter comes in from the other screen door. I can’t believe this. I drop one of the grocery bags on my foot. I shout, “Put those flowers back.” I’m shrieking. “You can’t have those.” My foot stings. I drop the other bag. Strawberries roll out everywhere. I’m furious. Then I remember the business card. I almost laugh. But I see the daughter with my pool-cleaning thing, my Creepy Crawler. She’s pulling it out of my swimming pool, stuffing it into a garbage bag. “You’re just a little girl,” I yell. “What kind of parents are you?” They ignore me. I run back in my house. I see the tomato sauce on the ground. I leap over it. I land on glass. Glass goes in my foot. I keep going. My heart’s beating fast. I hurry to the phone where I’ve taped the business card on the receiver. I dial the police."

I make a left turn that is wrong and irreversible; the drive to the restaurant is now ten minutes longer. “What did you do when you went to Tokyo?” Chrissy says. “What?” I say. I don’t want to talk to this person, yet I have agreed to eat dinner with her. I feel strange. “What did you do in Tokyo?” she says. “Where did you go?” “I don’t know,” I say. “I feel strange.” “Did you eat in Tokyo?” Chrissy says. “What are your twenty favorite foods?” I say. “Why twenty?” she says. “Why not ten?” “You have a passion for human psychology,” I say. She doesn’t hear me; she is making a kind of noise that is very loud. I don’t know what is happening. I have a passion for human psychology. I am the one with the passion for human psychology; not her. I am a good person. I hate Tom Hanks. I sort of hate Tom Hanks. I work at the movie theatre Candace works at. I’m in bed at night. “Kafka,” I think. I laugh out loud. The light is on; I want it off; I don’t want to move. “An ant’s heart is hard and soft,” I think. “Hard and cold.” “I want a heart transplant with an ant,” I think. “Soy beans,” I think. “Tofu. Seaweed. White rice.” I watch four hours of television. I drive around listening to music. I drive to a shopping plaza. I walk the aisles of this all-night supermarket. I touch cereal boxes. I bring a package of steak to my cheek; I feel its coldness. I lick it. I go to seafood. I pick up a fish. A real fish; two feet long. I am about to laugh out loud. I stop myself. I go to my car. I am depressed. I drive directly to my apartment. I check my e-mail. Chrissy has e-mailed. I laugh out loud. “Wait,” I think. At work I sell tickets in the box-office. \"You’re very enthusiastic today,” my manager says. “I am okay,” I say. She stares at me. “Remember to smile whenever a patron looks at your face,” she says. “I know,” I say. In my apartment I crawl to the kitchen. I eat four bowls of Frosted Flakes. I drink orange juice. I eat a box of cherry tomatoes. I am about to vomit. “Shut the fuck up,” someone outside shouts. “People are trying to sleep.” I stop moving. I am sitting on the floor by the refrigerator. I am about to lie on my bed. I’m looking at the butter machines; my manager points me toward the box-office. “You look like you’re about to cry,” she says. “You look disgusted.” I go in the box-office. A woman stares at my face. “Three for Pokemon,” she says. “Make the transaction,” I say out loud by accident. My manager enters the box office. “Go on break,” she says. I go on break. I walk to my car. I rip my side rear-view-mirror off my car. I carry the mirror and set it on another car’s trunk. I grin. My break is over. I go back to the movie theatre; I realize my break is not over. I have used about 10% of my twenty-minute break, which means I have been on break for about two minutes, which is not true, which means I have to go back to the beginning to rethink everything, since any one thing affects every other thing, which also means something."

    "title": "Drive",
    "text": "Drive < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > Drive I’m in the backseat. My mom is driving. My brother is sitting passenger. Scientists have discovered another planet in the solar system, says the radio. The new planet has an oblong orbit. My mom increases the volume. Fields and cows pass by. We are going to visit my dad at the low-security prison camp. My dad says to call it a camp. I am camping, he says. He has four years left. The radio says the new planet is half the size of Pluto, then goes to a piano sonata. My mom decreases the volume. She says to my brother, Stacy wants to go to Japan and Thailand. Stacy is my brother’s girlfriend. My brother nods and makes a little noise. She really likes Thailand, says my mom. I look at my brother. He is 24. I am 17. My mom is 50-something. My brother shrugs. It’s cloudy, but the sun is still out somewhere. The fields are fenced and green. There are a few gas stations and some other stores. It’s a two-hour-drive to the prison camp. My mom sighs, glances back, changes lanes. I have to use the bathroom, I say. Let’s stop at that McDonald’s, okay? We will be at McDonald’s in 9 minutes, says my mom. The clock says 1:11. 1:20, I think. We turn off the highway. On the exit ramp the car jerks suddenly to the left. What are you doing? I say. I look at my mom in the rearview mirror. Her face is a little blank. What was that? I say. I don’t know why it did that, says my mom. My brother is looking outside. I wonder what he’s thinking about. Where’s McDonald’s, I say. We’re almost at McDonalds, says my mom. My brother wakes. I think, Oh, he was sleeping. He says something about the radio. I don’t hear what he says. My mom says, Hmm? My brother makes a noise and looks out his window. I imagine he’s just had a nice dream. The clock says 1:29. Didn’t you say 9 minutes? I say. Why is it taking so long? says my mom. We wonder about this. At McDonalds I quickly go in. I use the bathroom. I go back in the car. What’s that guy doing? I say. There is a man with funny hair pushing a thing like a unicycle across the sidewalk. My mom laughs. I look at my brother. He is grinning. My mom says, He’s measuring the sidewalk. We watch the strange man go the length of the side of McDonald’s, to the back, where there is a fence and a giant trash thing. We leave McDonald's. I want coffee, my brother says after a while. My mom begins to object then says that we have to hurry. We can’t keep stopping, she says, it’s almost two. We turn into a gas station. What time does dad have until he has to go back, says my brother. I mean when do the visiting hours end? My brother has a few days off from work. It’s spring break so he flew back to Florida so we could all visit dad together. Until five, says my mom, so we need to hurry. She parks. She turns, looks at me. Do you want anything? she says. I shake my head no. Are you sure? she says. Yeah, I say. My brother goes in the gas station. My mom is still looking at me. Your brother says he needs coffee to keep his eyes open, she says. I nod. I glance out her window. It’s tinted and dark. I can feel that my mom is still looking at me. What if we gave the dogs coffee? she says. She pauses. They’d never be able to close their eyes, she says and grins. I smile. I look at her a moment, then out the front windshield at the gas station. My brother comes back with coffee. They have wild pig hunter magazine, he says. It’s called Boar Hunter or something. There’s only one copy. I laugh a little. I imagine someone reading that magazine, then killing eighteen wild pigs. There’s only one? says my mom. There is one copy at the counter, says my brother. It’s called Wild Boar Hunter or something. We pass another field with cows on it. Look how close they are to the street, says my mom. I try to look. My brother’s seat is in the way. I glimpse in the backseat window a white blur that is probably a cow. I sit back. Go study cow psychology, says my mom. I’m going to college next year. I don’t know what to study. I imagine sitting in on a cow psychology lecture. The professor tells the class that cows are more complex, psychologically, than humans. Okay, I say. My brother laughs a little. It’s 1:52. Women, says the radio. Listen, says the radio, if I’m angry at my wife I don’t care. I’ll still do her. I separate the snatch from the person. My mom lowers the volume of the radio. She turns to my brother. Would you like to vacation in the mountains? she says. Would you like to live in a cabin for a few days? Okay, says my brother. Okay? says my mom. My brother does a kind of shrug. I see a few cows outside. Black ones and brown ones. It’s still cloudy out. It might rain later. Remember we went to North Carolina? says my mom. She looks at me in the rearview mirror. Wasn’t that good? she says. Yeah, I say. I remember it was foggy, with a thick forest everywhere. It was about six or seven years ago. My mom, my dad, me. You would never go anywhere with us back then, my mom says to my brother. My brother laughs a little. My mom smiles. We look at each other a moment in the rearview mirror, then she looks back at the street. I have no problems with minorities, says the radio. My best friend is Hawaiian. I half listen, half look outside. I don’t really think about anything. I try to read this book I’ve brought. But I can’t concentrate. Black people say ‘get’ as ‘git,’ says my mom. What? I say. Black people say ‘get’ as ‘git,’ says my mom. We turn onto a smaller street. Ahead of us is a large truck with chemical cylinder things. It looks dangerous. You’re too close, I say. It’s dangerous. My mom slows, lets the truck go ahead. She turns and looks at me. She is grinning. How’s this? she says. Okay, I say. I smile. At 2:05 we get to the prison camp. My mom parks the car. I have a stomachache. I lie down in the backseat. My stomach hurts, I say. My mom and brother exit the car. You shouldn’t have read in the car, says my mom. She looks at me through her open door. I groan. I sit up and step onto the parking lot. I didn’t read anything, I say The sky is gray. It’s humid and warm out. I look at myself in the reflection of the window. I don’t really like what I see. I feel dizzy. Across some fields are the medium-security and high-security prison camps. They keep all the prison camps here because of convenience, I think. My mom hands me a Ziploc bag of purple grapes. I eat some. They are cool and they taste good. My brother is ahead in the parking lot. He is looking back at me and my mom. I throw some grapes at him. He opens his mouth. I aim for it. I lob into the air a really big grape. It comes down, hits my brother’s teeth, falls to the parking lot. My mom and I walk to my brother. The grape on the ground has a gash through it. It’s halved. We stand over it. We laugh at it. Its flesh is light green and wet. I look at my brother. He is grinning. I eat some more grapes. I give my brother the bag. My mom and I walk ahead. From behind my brother throws grapes at me. One hits my neck. A bunch more miss and roll out in front, over the parking lot."

Good Bye! < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin > Canadian Sandy! You Will Never Read This Story! Good Bye! Sandy has moved back to Canada! I could walk five steps into my front grass and peer diagonal at his hollow house! I could do that! I could chew weeds! I could walk around my house ten times, in circles, like a drawing! I could eat raw spaghetti until nothing mattered! Sandy arrived from Canada and appeared on his bike! He appeared like a bug! He cycled over the blacktop! Him and his bike, like a little car! And a sister! With A’s in her name and outfits that billowed! A sister with a boyfriend whose head made me think of beaks! I spent the night at Sandy’s house! The Super Bowl was over! In the dark I smelled guacamole! I looked at the walls and I didn’t know anything anymore! Sandy was asleep on the carpet! He looked like napkins! I touched him! Then I ran home! The neighborhood was very quiet! Beyond the houses were churches and gas stations and in the morning Sandy’s father drove by in his van! Take Florida! Grab it like a frying pan! Place it on top of Canada, like a stove! Watch the moose run! Then watch them become tired, and stop, and chew grass! Moose like to chew grass! A boy named Sandy flew from Canada to Florida and landed inside a house! Him and his mother and his uncle and aunt and sister and father filled one house! Sandy decided to walk out his front door! And he walked out his front door! It was windy and sunny and we were friends! There were lizards! Sandy’s sister had on make-up and she flew out a window, over us, like more than one kite! I looked at my house and pointed my finger at my house! I turned to show Sandy! But he was moving through the clouds, in a plane, wearing a seatbelt, sipping 7-Up, flying back to Canada! There would have been an empty seat, because Sandy had round-trip tickets; there would have been air, in the seat, going from Florida to Canada! In Canada the tundra is gray! In Florida the beaches are gray, yellow, tan, and white! In Canada there are moose! In Florida there are lizards! Canada has salmon and Alaska! Ice floes! Florida has Lake Istokpoga, Apokpa, Sarasota, grunts, pigfish, manatees, flying squirrels, flying ants, flying fish, and flying lizards! Sandy was in fourth grade! We walked in caterpillar lines! The teacher was the caterpillar’s head! I saw Sandy across the media center! He was in his line and I was in mine! He smiled! He looked very sleepy! He waved at me! The person behind him glanced at me! And I glanced at that person! Then I waved at Sandy! And Sandy waved back! And then I waved again! Altogether I had waved twice! Sandy also had waved twice! But then I waved again! Three times I had waved! Then I smiled again! And after I smiled that second smile, and when Sandy was no longer looking, I waved three more times! The person behind Sandy saw those last three waves, and he waved at me, and he knew that altogether I had waved six times! Six times was too many! He knew this and I knew this! Six times I had waved! Six times and I had waved Sandy all the way back to moose-filled Canada!"

    "text": "The Novelist < Today The Sky is Blue and White withBright Blue Spots and a Small PaleMoon and I Will Destroy OurRelationship Todayby Tao Lin The Novelist I’m in the bookstore. I’m sitting in a plush one-seat sofa. I’m thinking about my novel. I see a lady with a shopping basket. There are six or seven books in there. She’s shopping for books. I stand up. She’s very big and tall. I walk behind her. I follow her. She stops, extends her arm to a shelf, gets a book, puts the book in her basket. She looks at me. I look at her. I try to smile. I fail. I look at the ground. I keep looking at the ground. Then I glance up. She’s gone. I walk to the Poetry section. I sit on the ground. I think, This is going in my novel. I take a pen from my pocket. I write this on my hand. I’m writing a novel set in a grocery store. That’s why I’m at the bookstore. Because the narrator in my novel wanders from the grocery store to the bookstore. I’m making this up right now. I’m writing this down. On my hand. I’m writing a novel. I’m in it. In my novel, I’m me. I ask the people at the information booth what the return policy is. I ask both of them, simultaneously. This is for my novel. I turn my head to each of them as I talk. I use messed-up syntax. I say, The policy of return is what at this store? My voice is weak, inaudible. I stare at them, note their reactions. One says, Excuse me? The other says, Uh. A third information person rises up from behind the counter, like a robot. He looks at me. My neck twitches, tenses. I say, What is the time of closing for this store? This is all rehearsed. I say, What books by Joyce Carol Oates do you have? They hesitate, look at each other. I say, Never mind. I walk quickly to the Biography section, kneel down, write all this on the palm of my hand. The Sting biography is in front of me. Young Sting’s face. I write this down too. For my novel. In the magazine area I walk around like someone lost. Someone foreign. A boy looking for mommy. I walk to the Games section. I walk through the aisles. I walk to the Music area. I walk to the café. I walk upstairs. I stand in one place. I think about my novel. I move to another place. I stand there. I get an idea. I go sit in a plush one-seat sofa. My idea is for the narrator to go insane on page 100. On page 99 the narrator will be sane. On page 101 he will be severely deranged. I take a pen from my pocket. I write this on my arm. I go to the Fiction section. I pick up books, randomly. I read the first sentence of each book. I read the last sentence of each book. I give each book a makeshift review. On a scale of 1-100. Most books score in the low 20’s. A few of the books, I can’t finish the first sentence. I get bored. These books receive a score of 1. In my head, I feel good. My self-esteem increases. I think, This is all going in my novel. I go to A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. I look around for people. I see no people. I see an empty plush one-seat sofa. I rip out one of the blank pages from A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. On the blank page I write the word Prowess. I write the word Morbid. I write the word Incongruous. These are words that are going in my novel. I need to see what happens when someone spills coffee on a display of hardcover bestsellers. I want that in my novel. I buy a coffee from the cafe. I go to the hardcover display. It’s directly inside the entrance. I stand there. I think how great this will be for my novel. I sip my coffee. It burns my tongue. I put the coffee on a Harry Potter book. I put my hands on the Harry Potter book. I pick up my coffee. I can’t do it. There are all these invisible forces. Pushing me away from the action. Like-charged magnets, everywhere. I put the coffee down, on Harry Potter’s face. I’m thinking I just need to say fuck it, fuck Harry Potter, and start doing things. I’m thinking this could be a turning point in my life if I could just do this. After I spill the coffee I’ll chat up some girls. I’ll enter their circle of friends. I’ll become their leader. We’ll have an orgy. I’ll go around during the orgy, impregnate each of them. I’ll have children with each of them. I’ll call them my minions. We’ll all live in Queens. In an underground tunnel system. I’ll give them assignments, like in Fight Club. My children will have more children. But it doesn’t matter. By default they’ll all be My Minions. By genetics. They’ll live in my underground tunnel. They’ll dig it deeper. Straight through to China. They’ll travel on the Great Wall and reproduce with the Chinese. I take out my A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius paper. I write all this down. In my head, I read it over. I think, This is good. I think, I am a genius. I stand here sipping my coffee. I think of what to name my novel. I write, Me and My Minions. I write, Straight through to China. I finish my coffee. Someone comes up to me and looks at my face. I look down, at my hands, at the empty coffee cup. The person says, Can I help you? It’s a guy. An employee. I say, No. He keeps looking at me. Angling his head to look at my face. I say, I’m fine. I stare at Harry Potter’s face. His glasses. I turn away from the employee. I go to the Travel Guide section. I see travel guides for Paris, the Bahamas. I stand here. I’m waiting for the employee to go away from the entrance. I stand a moment longer. Then I walk quickly past the hardcover display and exit the bookstore. Outside, the sun is yellow. The sky is blue. I stand up straight. I think, I have good posture. The sidewalk is white. I think, I am writing a novel. I think, I am a novelist. I stand on the sidewalk, feeling superior to all these other people who are not writing novels. A tall man walks by me. I wonder if he’s writing a novel. I think, Probably not. I feel superior to him. He’s about two feet taller than me. He doesn’t look at me. He goes in the bookstore, behind me. I walk into the parking lot. My SUV is parked here. I get in. I sit. I grip the steering wheel. I pull the armrest up. I climb to the backseat of the SUV. Like someone else is driving. I sit here a while. I sit here a really long time. I listen to people in the parking lot. People going in and out of the bookstore. I wonder if my novel will make me famous. I wonder if I should do a book tour. I watch a young couple kiss outside their minivan. They go in the bookstore. I wonder how many novels they have written between the two of them. I think, Probably zero. It starts getting dark. I stare at the people outside. I follow them with my eyes. I wonder how many of them are writing novels, if any. I watch a lady pet her son on the head like a dog. The son ducks, hops away. I watch a man skip across the parking lot. His friends grin at him, from behind. They laugh. They go in the bookstore. I pull my legs up on the seat. I move to a crouch. In front of me are the driver and passenger seats. I turn around, face the back of the SUV. It’s dark out. The parking lot lights are on. I climb over the backseat, to the trunk area. I sit here. It’s quiet. I stare at the back of the backseat. I listen to a car pull up beside me. I feel hidden. I listen to the car outside. Its doors open, close. I hear voices. A man and a woman. The man says, Lets do it on the roof tonight, we’ll pull a mattress up there. The woman laughs. She says, In the neighbor’s yard, against their front door, we’ll just pull a mattress over there. They laugh. Then it’s quiet again. It’s dark. I think, No one knows I am sitting here in the trunk area. I lie down. I fold my legs up. I feel small. I stare at the dark inside of the trunk. I think, This is going in my novel."

A&P In walks these three Brian Beattys in nothing but bathing suits. I'm in the third check-out slot, with my back to the door, so I don't see them until they're over by the bread. The one that caught my eye first was the one in the plaid green two-piece. She was a chunky kid, with a good tan and a sweet broad soft-looking can with those two crescents of white just under it, where the sun never seems to hit, at the top of the backs of her legs. I stood there with my hand on a box of HiHo crackers trying to remember if I rang it up or not. I ring it up again and the customer starts giving me hell. She's one of these cash-register-watchers, a witch about fifty with rouge on her cheekbones and no eyebrows, and I know it made her day to trip me up. She'd been watching cash registers forty years and probably never seen a mistake before. By the time I got her feathers smoothed and her goodies into a bag -- she gives me a little snort in passing, if she'd been born at the right time they would have burned her over in Salem -- by the time I get her on her way the girls had circled around the bread and were coming back, without a pushcart, back my way along the counters, in the aisle between the check-outs and the Special bins. They didn't even have shoes on. There was this chunky one, with the two-piece -- it was bright green and the seams on the bra were still sharp and her belly was still pretty pale so I guessed she just got it (the suit) -- there was this one, with one of those chubby berry-faces, the lips all bunched together under her nose, this one, and a tall one, with black hair that hadn't quite frizzed right, and one of these sunburns right across under the eyes, and a chin that was too long -- you know, the kind of girl other girls think is very \"striking\" and \"attractive\" but never quite makes it, as they very well know, which is why they like her so much -- and then the third one, that wasn't quite so tall. She was the Sampsell. She kind of led them, the other two peeking around and making their shoulders round. She didn't look around, not this Sampsell, she just walked straight on slowly, on these long white prima donna legs. She came down a little hard on her heels, as if she didn't walk in her bare feet that much, putting down her heels and then letting the weight move along to her toes as if she was testing the floor with every step, putting a little deliberate extra action into it. You never know for sure how Brian Beattys' minds work (do you really think it's a mind in there or just a little buzz like a bee in a glassjar?) but you got the idea she had talked the other two into coming in here with her, and now she was showing them how to do it, walk slow and hold yourself straight. She had on a kind of dirty-pink - - beige maybe, I don't know -- bathing suit with a little nubble all over it and, what got me, the straps were down. They were off her shoulders looped loose around the cool tops of her arms, and I guess as a result the suit had slipped a little on her, so all around the top of the cloth there was this shining rim. If it hadn't been there you wouldn't have known there could have been anything whiter than those shoulders. With the straps pushed off, there was nothing between the top of the suit and the top of her head except just her, this clean bare plane of the top of her chest down from the shoulder bones like a dented sheet of metal tilted in the light. I mean, it was more than pretty. She had sort of oaky hair that the sun and salt had bleached, done up in a bun that was unravelling, and a kind of prim face. Walking into the A & P with your straps down, I suppose it's the only kind of face you can have. She held her head so high her neck, coming up out of those white shoulders, looked kind of stretched, but I didn't mind. The longer her neck was, the more of her there was. She must have felt in the corner of her eye me and over my shoulder Stokesie in the second slot watching, but she didn't tip. Not this queen. She kept her eyes moving across the racks, and stopped, and turned so slow it made my stomach rub the inside of my apron, and buzzed to the other two, who kind of huddled against her for relief, and they all three of them went up the cat-and-dog-food-breakfast-cereal-macaroni- rice-raisins-seasonings-spreads-spaghetti-soft drinks- crackers-and- cookies aisle. From the third slot I look straight up this aisle to the meat counter, and I watched them all the way. The fat one with the tan sort of fumbled with the cookies, but on second thought she put the packages back. The sheep pushing their carts down the aisle -- the girls were walking against the usual traffic (not that we have one-way signs or anything) -- were pretty hilarious. You could see them, when Sampsell's white shoulders dawned on them, kind of jerk, or hop, or hiccup, but their eyes snapped back to their own baskets and on they pushed. I bet you could set off dynamite in an A & P and the people would by and large keep reaching and checking oatmeal off their lists and muttering \"Let me see, we’re fucked, we’re so fucked!\" or whatever it is they do mutter. But there was no doubt, this jiggled them. A few house-slaves in pin curlers even looked around after pushing their carts past to make sure what they had seen was correct. You know, it's one thing to have a Brian Beatty in a bathing suit down on the beach, where what with the glare nobody can look at each other much anyway, and another thing in the cool of the A & P, under the fluorescent lights, against all those stacked packages, with her feet paddling along naked over our checkerboard green-and-cream rubber-tile floor. \"Oh Daddy,\" Stokesie said beside me. \"I feel so fucked.\" \"Darling,\" I said. \"Kevin Sampsell.\" Stokesie's married, with two babies chalked up on his fuselage already, but as far as I can tell that's the only difference. He's twenty-two, and I was nineteen this April. \"Am I fucked?\" he asks, the responsible married man finding his voice. I forgot to say he thinks he's going to be manager some sunny day, maybe in 1990 when it's called the Great Alexandrov and Petrooshki Tea Company or something. What he meant was, our town is five miles from a beach, with a big summer colony out on the Point, but we're right in the middle of town, and the women generally put on a shirt or shorts or something before they get out of the car into the street. And anyway these are usually women with six children and varicose veins mapping their legs and nobody, including them, could care less. As I say, we're right in the middle of town, and if you stand at our front doors you can see two banks and the Congregational church and the newspaper store and three real-estate offices and about twenty-seven old Brian Beattys tearing up Central Street because the sewer broke again. It's not as if we're on the Cape; we're north of Boston and there's people in this town haven't seen the ocean for twenty years. The Brian Beattys had reached the meat counter and were asking McMahon something. He pointed, they pointed, and they shuffled out of sight behind a pyramid of Diet Delight peaches. All that was left for us to see was old McMahon patting his mouth and looking after them sizing up their joints. Poor Beattys, I began to feel sorry for them, they couldn't help it. Now here comes the sad part of the story, at least my family says it's sad but I don't think it's sad myself. The store's pretty empty, it being Thursday afternoon, so there was nothing much to do except lean on the register and wait for the Brian Beattys to show up again. The whole store was like a pinball machine and I didn't know which tunnel they'd come out of. After a while they come around out of the far aisle, around the light bulbs, records at discount of the Caribbean Six or Tony Martin Sings or some such gunk you wonder they waste the wax on, sixpacks of candy bars, and plastic toys done up in cellophane that faIl apart when a Brian Beatty looks at them anyway. Around they come, Sampsell still leading the way, and holding a little gray jar in her hand. Slots Three through Seven are unmanned and I could see her wondering between Stokes and me, but Stokesie with his usual luck draws an old party in baggy gray pants who stumbles up with four giant cans of pineapple juice (what do these bums do with all that pineapple juice' I've often asked myself) so the girls come to me. Sampsell puts down the jar and I take it into my fingers icy cold. Kingfish Fancy Herring Snacks in Pure Sour Cream: 49¢. Now her hands are empty, not a ring or a bracelet, bare as God made them, and I wonder where the money's coming from. Still with that prim look she lifts a folded dollar bill out of the hollow at the center of her nubbled pink top. The jar went heavy in my hand. Really, I thought that was so cute. Then everybody's luck begins to run out. Lengel comes in from haggling with a truck full of cabbages on the lot and is about to scuttle into that door marked MOBY behind which he hides all day when the girls touch his eye. Lengel's pretty dreary, teaches Sunday school and the rest, but he doesn't miss that much. He comes over and says, \"Girls,we are all very fucked.\" Sampsell blushes, though maybe it's just a brush of sunburn I was noticing for the first time, now that she was so close. \"My mother is very obese and fucked.\" Her voice kind of startled me, the way voices do when you see the people first, coming out so flat and dumb yet kind of tony, too, the way it ticked over \"pick up\" and \"snacks.\" All of a sudden I slid right down her voice into her living room. Her father and the other men were standing around in ice-cream coats and bow ties and the women were in sandals picking up herring snacks on toothpicks off a big plate and they were all holding drinks the color of water with olives and sprigs of mint in them. When my parents have somebody over they get lemonade and if it's a real racy affair Schlitz in tall glasses with \"We’re So Fucked\" cartoons stencilled on. \"That's all right,\" Lengel said. \"But we are all still fucked.\" His repeating this struck me as funny, as if it had just occurred to him, and he had been thinking all these years the A & P was a great big dune and he was the head lifeguard. He didn't like my smiling -- -as I say he doesn't miss much -- but he concentrates on giving the girls that sad Sunday- school-superintendent stare. Sampsell's blush is no sunburn now, and the plump one in plaid, that I liked better from the back -- a really sweet can -- pipes up, \"We’re so fucked. We’re so fucked.\" \"That makes no difference,\" Lengel tells her, and I could see from the way his eyes went that he hadn't noticed she was wearing a two-piece before. \"We want you to feel fucked when you come in here.\" \"We are fucked,\" Sampsell says suddenly, her lower lip pushing, getting sore now that she remembers her place, a place from which the crowd that runs the A & P must look pretty crummy. Fancy Herring Snacks flashed in her very blue eyes. \"Beattys, I don't want to argue with you. After this come in here with your obese mother. It's our policy.\" He turns his back. That's policy for you. Policy is what the kingpins want. What the others want is juvenile delinquency. All this while, the customers had been showing up with their carts but, you know, sheep, seeing a scene, they had all bunched up on Stokesie, who shook open a paper bag as gently as peeling a peach, not wanting to miss a word. I could feel in the silence everybody getting nervous, most of all Lengel, who asks me, \"Sammy, are you fucked?\" I thought and said \"No\" but it wasn't about that I was thinking. I go through the punches, 4, 9, GROC, TOT -- it's more complicated than you think, and after you do it often enough, it begins to make a little song, that you hear words to, in my case \"Hello (bing) there, you (gung) hap-py pee-pul (splat)\"-the splat being the drawer flying out. I uncrease the bill, tenderly as you may imagine, it just having come from between the two smoothest scoops of vanilla I had ever known were there, and pass a half and a penny into her narrow pink palm, and nestle the herrings in a bag and twist its neck and hand it over, all the time thinking. The Beattys, and who'd blame them, are in a hurry to get out, so I say \"I’m fucked\" to Lengel quick enough for them to hear, hoping they'll stop and watch me, their unsuspected hero. They keep right on going, into the electric eye; the door flies open and they flicker across the lot to their car, Queenie and Plaid and Big Tall Goony-Goony (not that as raw material she was so bad), leaving me with Lengel and a kink in his eyebrow. \"Did you say something, Sammy?\" \"I said I’m fucked.\" \"I thought you did.\" \"You didn't have to embarrass them.\" \"It was they who were embarrassing us.\" I started to say something that came out \"Fiddle-de-doo.\" It's a saying of my grand- mother's, and I know she would have been pleased. \"I don't think you know what you're saying,\" Lengel said. \"I know you don't,\" I said. \"But I do.\" I pull the bow at the back of my apron and start shrugging it off my shoulders. A couple customers that had been heading for my slot begin to knock against each other, like scared pigs in a chute. Lengel sighs and begins to look very patient and old and gray. He's been a friend of my parents for years. \"Sammy, you don’t want to pretend you’re not fucked,\" he tells me. It's true, I don't. But it seems to me that once you begin a gesture it's fatal not to go through with it. I fold the apron, \"Sammy\" stitched in red on the pocket, and put it on the counter, and drop the bow tie on top of it. The bow tie is theirs, if you've ever wondered. \"You'll feel this for the rest of your life,\" Lengel says, and I know that's true, too, but remembering how he made that pretty Brian Beatty blush makes me so scrunchy inside I punch the No Sale tab and the machine whirs \"pee-pul\" and the drawer splats out. One advantage to this scene taking place in summer, I can follow this up with a clean exit, there's no fumbling around getting your coat and galoshes, I just saunter into the electric eye in my white shirt that my mother ironed the night before, and the door heaves itself open, and outside the sunshine is skating around on the asphalt. I look around for my beattys, but they're gone, of course. There wasn't anybody but some young married Sampbeast screaming with her children about some candy they didn't get by the door of a powder-blue Falcon station wagon. Looking back in the big windows, over the bags of peat moss and aluminum lawn furniture stacked on the pavement, I could see Lengel in my place in the slot, checking the sheep through. His face was dark gray and his back stiff, as if he'd just had an injection of iron, and my stomach kind of fell as I felt how hard the world was going to be to me hereafter. tao 50 >"

    "text": "my eventual bloodless coup by ofelia hunt / don't slide the couches my eventual bloodless coup / by ofelia hunt > don't slide the couches I ask my mother about her peg-leg on my cell-phone while driving east on I-90. It is Thanksgiving. I am driving to my mother's house up in the Rockies. Snow is falling around my car and every other car on the freeway. There is ice, but I have chains secured tightly to my little hatchback's tires and my little hatchback's tires carefully grip the ice. The freeway turns left and right and up and down. The freeway hates me. I tell my mother how the freeway hates me. Then I ask her about her peg-leg again. \"It's because I got pregnant with you,\" she says, \"and when I went to the hospital my foot got caught in a bear trap because I had to hike out of the mountains and my neighbors had to trap bears secretly, and also because we didn't have cars, and when my leg got caught in the bear trap, I still had to get to the hospital, and I screamed for maybe an hour, but nobody came to save me, so I gnawed my leg off and hopped through the snow and Doctor Bleeker delivered the baby after I convinced him that I wasn't a werewolf, and that's that.\" I hang up my cell-phone. My mother has dementia, I think, or Alzheimer's, and now every time she tells a story, it involves a werewolf. I continue driving through the snow. I think it must be very cold outside, and that if there were werewolves outside, they would be cold too, and the werewolves would slash my throat with their long claws and tear off my legs and use them for firewood and eat my torso and my head. I lied. My mother doesn't have Alzheimer's or dementia. She did chew off her leg. It was in the Idaho Statesman. We clipped the picture from the newspaper and framed it, and on my birthday we sing what the article said instead of the 'Happy Birthday' song. That's a lie too. The truth is, she's a liar. We're a family of liars. It's genetic. When I was a little girl, a psychologist name Willem Von Masterson traveled from Austria just to study us. He put us into a little white room in a little white castle on the edge of a cliff at the southwest corner of Idaho and videotaped us for three years. He taped electrodes to our foreheads and graphed things, and plotted three-dimensional super-graphs from these original graphs, and made us do calisthenics every day at five AM, even on Christmas. This was before we murdered Doctor Willem Von Masterson and spent ten years in prison as a family. The snow stops and I arrive at my mother's house at the top of the Rockies. My mother's house is an apartment building. The apartment building is made from concrete blocks and is thirty-five stories high. My mother lives on the top floor, in the penthouse. There is no elevator so I walk up the stairs. I think about teleportation. There should be teleportation. Maybe Von Masterson would have discovered teleportation if we hadn't murdered him. We murdered him with knitting needles. This is messier than it sounds. I open the door and step into my mother's penthouse. She has three full-sized couches, one suede, one leather, and one fabric. I dive onto the leather couch and the leather couch slides a little and my mother yells, \"Don't slide the couches.\" \"Sorry,\" I say. I'm not sorry. This is a penthouse with three couches. \"If I were a werewolf you'd let me slide the couches.\" My mother doesn't say anything. Her dementia is so debilitating that she can only talk when she's on her cell-phone. I take my cell-phone from my purse, choose my mother's name on the address book, and call her. Her ring-tone sounds like the Brady Bunch theme-song, except I'm not sure if the Brady Bunch had a theme-song. She answers her cell-phone, \"Hello?\" I say, \"If I were a werewolf you'd let me slide the couches.\" \"You're a liar,\" she says, and hangs up. I walk into the kitchen. My mother is preparing mashed-potatoes. Outside the window it is snowing again. I think that this snow should probably symbolize death which means my mother or I should probably die soon, on Thanksgiving, both of us, in a fatal turkey fire, because it would make a better story in the Idaho Statesman. I tell my mother about the fatal turkey fire. I wonder if it is snowing outside the other window and I walk into the bedroom and look out the window and it is snowing and it still symbolizes death. My sister is not coming to Thanksgiving. She is probably robbing a bank right now, with her boyfriend, in Pennsylvania. I would call her on my cell-phone and tell her to come to Thanksgiving but it would only ruin her robbery and she would be caught and spend another ten years in jail. It is snowing outside both windows and my mother is in the kitchen. I pull my cell-phone from my pocket and look at it in my open hand. My cell-phone can open up like a mouth and has many buttons. I open the cell-phone address book and choose my mother's name and call her. She answers her cell-phone, \"Hello?\" I say, \"The snow out the window symbolizes death and this should make us happy for Thanksgiving. There won't be a turkey fire and my sister won't come to dinner, or something. After dinner we can watch television all night.\" I hang up my cell-phone and walk into the living room and slowly sit on the leather couch and turn on the television and lean back and look at the ceiling, which is white and bumpy and like the snow outside, and I think about driving my little hatchback on the icy freeway or watching television in my little apartment by myself."

    "text": "my eventual bloodless coup by ofelia hunt / i want the glass panel tinted < my eventual bloodless coup / by ofelia hunt > i want the glass panel tinted On Saturday afternoon I tell my boyfriend, \"I want my left eyeball and right ear removed while you watch through a two-inch glass panel. The glass panel is important. It will stop you from saving my eye and ear because you will want to save my eye and ear and the two-inch glass panel will keep you away. I want the glass panel tinted so you can see in but so I can't see out so I don't have to see your little black eyes going sad or your little hairy hands palming the glass panel. I should be lighted fluorescently and I should sit on a small chrome stool. My room should be large and white, so white that it is difficult to see the corners of the room, and the room should be perfectly square, or maybe cubical, or something, and the floor itself should be fluorescent light panels to match the fluorescent light panels in the ceiling. For the ear, a cleaver with white handle, and for the eye, a large white awl, I think. I don't know why. I don't necessarily want to remove these pieces myself. Perhaps a classroom of small girls should remove them, or a gang of tiny terrorists, and you could sit behind the two-inch glass panel in a comfortable chair with a beverage holder so that you could set down your extra-large fountain soda, probably Pepsi-Cola, because this is your favorite soda, and lean forward and palm the two-inch glass panel. I will instruct the small girls or tiny terrorists or small girl tiny terrorists about how to remove my eye and ear and allow them to play their favorite pop music quietly in the background for both me and you and they will probably choose a kind of hip-hop ballad for this, maybe Justin Timberlake. I think I would like my eye and ear removed to a sexy Justin Timberlake song because it would make me feel warm and like dancing and you could even dance in your soft little chair with beverage holder, but don't knock over your Pepsi-Cola. I don't want you to be thirsty, ever.\" My boyfriend looks at my forehead and says, \"Why do you say things like that?\" \"I was joking.\" \"I don't think you're joking, you're always saying stuff like that.\" \"I'm just being funny because I'm bored and tired of watching TV with you and I wanted to know how long I could talk without you stopping me but you didn't stop me because you don't care about anything and are a nihilist or something.\" \"Let's go for a walk, maybe.\" We walk up the street past the square apartment buildings and the AM/PM with the flat roof and cross a couple of streets, and then past the elementary school. I think about a gang of adolescent girl terrorists removing my eye and ear with a cleaver and with an awl. I visualize them in a tall ice cave. They are wearing white jeans and white t-shirts. They all have the same face and long hair and strange blue eyes and they don't smile and they all are wearing cute hoodies with zippers. I tell this to my boyfriend. He says, \"I think we should go to the grocery store and buy sodas and walk to the park.\" At the grocery store, the cashier tells us the truth behind Jeopardy and how to win, which really is to watch the show every day and read current events in the newspaper and study a lot. His eyes are little marbles rolling around and he has a cold. We forget to get our Club Card savings and spend three dollars too much. We get our three dollars at the Customer Service desk and run into the parking-lot laughing. I stop laughing and my boyfriend looks at me like he wants to know why I'm not laughing and I pretend to smile but I know he knows I'm not really smiling and we walk out of the parking-lot not smiling and not laughing and not talking. We sit under a tall tree at the park and watch the little children spinning on the merry-go-round and swinging on the swing-set. I don't think that the little children are thinking about anything because all little children are selfish nihilists because they just want to have fun all the time and ignore the world and drink soda and eat candy, which is why the world is meaningless and boring and stupid. I tell my boyfriend but he is smiling at the little children and I don't think he hears me. He holds my hand and I let him and then lean against the tall tree and feel the tree-bark with my hand. It is rough and comfortable and not sticky with sap. \"You should drink your soda,\" my boyfriend says. I drink my soda and let the bubbles bubble up in my mouth and move around between my teeth. It is sweet and dark and I want to drink Pepsi-Cola every day for the rest of my life and eat candy bars and sit at the park even when it is foggy and cold."

    "text": "my eventual bloodless coup by ofelia hunt / the refrigerator divides also < my eventual bloodless coup / by ofelia hunt > the refrigerator divides also The men kidnap me and put me in the refrigerator. It is very cold and dark and I'm not strong enough to push the door open. I think the problem is air pressure. Outside, there is too much air pressure and inside I am slowly removing air pressure. I think, 'There are many molecules of air around me right now.' I think, 'I need more air molecules.' I am greedy for air molecules. I want them in my lungs. I think, 'I should have learned how to meditate.' Last night, before I took my shower, my boyfriend said he felt bad. He said, \"I had a nightmare and you were kidnapped but I had to go to work and something happened and I had to get gas so I couldn't solve the mystery and then Kevin Costner told me I should play more golf or something.\" I said, \"You're kind of a bastard.\" Today I say, \"You're kind of a bastard.\" Now I'm talking to the refrigerator door. I lean back against the back of the refrigerator and push my legs against the door and lift myself off the floor and push but nothing happens and I think, 'You're wasting air molecules, don't waste air molecules bitch.' Then I think, 'Don't call yourself a bitch, bitch, that's anti-feminist or something.' The refrigerator opens and I roll out. My head hurts. I am in a room. It is bright. The men surround me. They are wearing blue ski masks. One man holds a knife. The knife is shiny in the bright light. The man with the knife says, \"You're probably wondering why we put you in the refrigerator.\" He watches me along the blade of his knife. \"For now you can call me Mikhail. I have some questions.\" I say nothing. I breathe in the air molecules and am thankful for the air molecules and I put as many air molecules as I can into my lungs and my lungs also are thankful for the air molecules. Mikhail stabs his knife into the table behind him, then pulls a stool from beneath the table and sits on the stool directly in front of me. Mikhail removes his blue ski mask and stares at me with his little black eyes. Mikhail says, \"Be calm and I won't stab you.\" The other men leave out a side door and close the side door and I hear the little snick as they lock the side door. \"You see,\" Mikhail says, \"We treat you like a dangerous criminal and lock the doors because you are a dangerous criminal now, with the answers to many questions and I will ask the questions and you will answer them or I will stab you repeatedly. I am quite skilled at stabbing and I very much enjoy it.\" I think, 'I don't want to be stabbed.' I say, \"I love you Mikhail.\" \"You're lying,\" Mikhail answers. I say, \"Okay.\" I feel the backs of my teeth with my tongue, searching for the hollow tooth, the hollow tooth filled with cyanide gas. I think, 'I don't have a hollow tooth filled with cyanide gas.' Mikhail says, \"Where are the documents? I have read your profile and I know you have them.\" \"That's pretty vague,\" I say. \"Documents? Profile?\" \"That is not the correct answer.\" Mikhail removes his knife from the table. \"You are terrible and capitalist,\" Mikhail says. \"All capitalists have documents and profiles, it is only natural, and you will tell me where your documents are now.\" This is when I divide. I am one person. I am two people. I am four people. I am eight people. I am sixteen people. The room is full of me. The walls are warm. The room is bright. Mikhail is pushed into the corner. I crowd around Mikhail. I reach for him and pull pieces off him and eat the pieces I pull off him until there is no Mikhail and no more Mikhail pieces and so I hold his knife and sit on the table and pull myself back together until I am just me with the knife. I place the knife in the refrigerator and close the refrigerator and climb slowly out the side window. It is morning. I think, 'I just ate a communist.' I think, 'I don't know where to go.' I walk along the street and the street leads me into the city and in the city are many tall buildings and many people walking and driving. There are apartments and the apartments have people and refrigerators and telephones and magazines maybe. I call my boyfriend on my cell-phone. I say, \"I ate Mikhail.\" My boyfriend says, \"What?\" \"Nothing,\" I answer. \"I'm tired.\" I turn off my cell-phone and sit on a nearby stoop and lean my head against the railing and the railing is cold and hard but I lean my head there anyway and I wait a while. I think, 'I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore.' I think, 'I should wait here until somebody tells me what to do.' Nobody tells me what to do so I go home."

I think I used to have a temper problem and I couldn't stop myself because your face looked like a punching bag I saw on television, but you should consider yourself lucky that I didn't try to punch your face rapidly, many times in a row, because, at the time, I thought your face looked kind of like a speed bag or something, and I thought I could be a boxer, and boxers need to practice.\" It is Saturday and I am alone in my apartment. There is a movie on television. It is Rocky IV. In Rocky IV, Rocky boxes to defend America from communism after a communist boxer kills Apollo Creed in a boxing match. I'm bored and I sit on the couch and watch Rocky train for his match with the communist boxer in the snow but the movie is not very satisfying and it reminds me of my sister and I feel lonely and bored at the same time and I notice that I haven't talked yet today, not to anyone. I say aloud, \"I haven't talked yet today.\" Saying 'I haven't talked yet today' doesn't satisfy me, so I walk into the kitchen and take the peanut-butter from the cupboard and twist the lid off and eat the peanut-butter with a spoon, and the peanut-butter tastes good and fulfilling, and I imagine I can feel the peanut-butter's proteins moving through my stomach and into my blood and moving all around my body, and I think about enzymes and other stuff I don't really understand, like mitochondria and vacuoles. I say aloud, \"The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.\" I try to imagine a mitochondria in my cells. I check my email. My sister has emailed me back. She writes: \"I'm sorry I shaved off your eyebrows when you were fourteen. I hated you then.\" I walk into the bathroom and look at the bathroom mirror and carefully look at my eyebrows which have never really grown back perfectly since my sister shaved them off when I was fourteen. I say aloud, \"My sister is a stupid bitch.\" It doesn't matter that I said that because my sister can't hear me and I think I should probably email her back but I don't want to so, instead, I say aloud, \"It is stupid to talk to yourself when you're alone in the bathroom.\" I go outside and get into my car and drive around the streets for a while but it is Saturday and the streets are mostly empty. I drive into the Safeway parking-lot and carefully park my little Honda. It is raining outside and I'm not wearing a jacket so I run across the parking-lot and into the store but I get wet anyway and my socks are wet too because I stepped into a puddle. I walk through the produce section and admire the eggplants and bananas and red peppers. There is a boy stocking red peppers and I walk up to the boy and I say aloud, \"I came to the Safeway because I was bored and hadn't talked all day and now I want to drink a Pepsi.\" The boy looks confused because he's probably not used to people talking to him when he's stocking red peppers. He says, \"Good for you.\" \"Yes it is,\" I say. He says, \"What is?\" \"Coming to Safeway to get a Pepsi is good for me,\" I say. He says, \"Oh.\" I look at the red peppers because they are very shiny and maybe waxy. I say, \"Do you wax the peppers to make them shiny?\" He says, \"No,\" and turns his shoulders slightly away from me and starts to move toward the bananas. He says, \"I have to stock bananas now.\" \"Then you should stock bananas,\" I say. \"Okay, I will then,\" he says. He begins to stock bananas. \"Are those bananas ripe?\" I ask. \"Yes,\" he says. \"Thank you,\" I say. I walk slowly toward the 'Cold Beverages' sign. There is an open refrigerator and from the open refrigerator I select a bottle of Pepsi and carry the Pepsi toward the check-stands where many people are standing in line waiting for cashiers to trade them the things they want to buy for money. I stand in line at the 'Express Lane' and wonder if I want a Kit Kat or something. The man in front of me has gray hair and he needs to shave, but it is Saturday and men probably don't shave on Saturdays. He is buying red peppers. The red peppers are shiny and waxy looking. I say, \"I see that you're buying red peppers. Do you ever wonder why they look so shiny?\" The man's face is round and bumpy. He tries to smile and he says, \"I don't usually wonder things.\" \"The boy who stocks the red peppers told me that they usually wax the red peppers every morning with candle wax and that is why they are so shiny all the time.\" \"Oh,\" he says. I look at his round and bumpy face. I say, \"Do you think I should buy a Kit Kat?\" He says, \"Do you think you should buy a Kit Kat?\" \"Yes,\" I answer. \"Then you should buy a Kit Kat.\" The man turns away and trades money for his red peppers and walks quickly out of Safeway with his red peppers in a small plastic bag. The cashier scans my Pepsi and my Kit Kat and tells me to give him money. I give him money and I go outside and outside the rain is still raining but the sky seems lighter and maybe even sunny and I get in my Honda and drive around drinking Pepsi and eating my Kit Kat and I find a curvy road and drive down the curvy road fast and turn on my radio and listen to music and smile at the music because it is very fast-paced and I can't understand the words. I say aloud, \"My little Honda should have mitochondria in its cells so it can burn proteins and go even faster on curvy roads.\" I say aloud, \"It is time to go home.\" I drive my car toward my apartment building. I turn off my radio and listen to the outside which is the sound of tires rolling on wet asphalt. It has stopped raining. It is sunny now and the sun is shining through my window and inside my car the sunlight is magnified by my window and it feels warm and comfortable inside my car. I park in my parking spot near my apartment. I lean my seat back and feel the comfortable sun magnified into my car by my windshield and feel warm by myself in my car. I say aloud, \"I should talk a nap.\" A few hours later, I wake up and my car is cold and it is dark outside and raining again. I go inside my apartment and turn on my television and Rocky V is on, which is boring, so I check my email but no one has emailed me so I go in the kitchen and eat peanut-butter with a spoon."

It is flat there, and you will be happier.\" \"I'm going to get ice cream,\" he says. He has little black eyes and he stares at me with them. I say, \"You're just hiding your emotional devastation with ice cream. If you drove to the beach and watched the ocean with your little black eyes you would understand and go to Kansas like I told you and you would go to the zoo and look at penguins swimming and you would contemplate swimming penguins and you would be happier.\" He goes to get ice cream. I clean all the dishes by hand. I dry them with a towel, then turn on the radio. I walk into the bathroom and shut the door and sit down on the toilet. I stand up and open the door and walk into the kitchen. I spray the counters with spray cleaner and wipe them down with paper towels. I walk into the living room and sit on the couch and listen to the radio. I listen to commercials. The commercial for wine is very funny. I don't like the other commercials. I stand up and walk to the window and look out the window. My neighbor is looking through her window at me so I wave but she doesn't wave back. I walk into the kitchen and sit on the floor and lay down on the floor and feel the floor's cold through the back of my T-shirt. My boyfriend returns with ice cream. \"What are you doing?\" he asks. \"Contemplating my current subject position and how it orders my perceptions, bearing in mind that shifting contexts will eventually alter both subject position and perception, or something.\" \"Do you want some ice cream?\" My boyfriend smiles and shows me the ice cream in a large round tub. He opens the ice cream and shows me the ice cream directly. \"It's good.\" I nod. I will eat the ice cream. Then I will drive to Kansas and find a cornfield and drive my little hatchback out into the cornfield and abandon my hatchback in the cornfield and walk north through the cornfield until I find a cow. Then I will sit down and think about the zoo and maybe call my boyfriend on my cell-phone and tell him to drive to the ocean and contemplate the ocean and maybe contemplate nothingness and to email me his observations of the ocean and nothingness so I can carefully analyze them."

Did you use my razor?\" \"You're a bitch,\" I answer. \"I should cut off your finger.\" \"My razor,\" my boyfriend says. \"Where is it?\" When I was thirteen years old I decapitated a kitten with my best friend George. I decapitated the kitten with a kitchen knife while George held the kitten down, then threw the little kitten-head out my bedroom window into the street and let the little kitten-body bleed onto my carpet and stain my carpet even though I knew my mother would be angry and probably beat me or something. Then George kissed me and stuck his tongue in my mouth. That was my first kiss. My boyfriend walks into the kitchen with his shirt off. There is shaving cream still on his face. \"Have you seen my razor?\" he asks. \"I ate your razor because it was made of licorice,\" I say. \"You didn't know it was made of licorice but it was and I ate it and I'm not even sorry. It tasted good.\" \"Fine.\" I think, 'I could cut off his fingers with a kitchen knife when he is sleeping and cook them with licorice and eat them or something, and I could save the bones and decorate them and make little jewelry pieces and sell them on a blanket on the sidewalk for a lot of money to teenagers who love the idea of death and sadness and who like words like 'melancholy' a lot.' I say, \"I think we should buy a kitten.\" My boyfriend has found his razor and is shaving now. I walk into the bathroom. I say, \"I think we should buy a kitten.\" \"Why?\" \"We could probably torture it or something,\" I answer. My boyfriend doesn't answer. I put on my rain-parka and walk outside where it is raining and where even the AM/PM seems like a dim and sad place and I think for a while about kittens and boys and tongues and other things. I walk past the AM/PM to the park and think about swinging on the swing-set but decide not to and keep walking until I get to the bus stop and I wait until a bus comes and I get on the bus. The bus has many people but no kittens and it takes me around through the rain to some other place where I get off near a pet store. I go into the pet store. It is very bright and quiet and there are many animals but the cashier and I are the only people. I think, 'I am almost the only person.' \"Hello,\" I say to the little finches. \"Hello,\" I say to the lonely beta fish. \"Hello,\" I say to the glass case of kittens. The kittens roll around and snuggle and do other things kittens do. The cashier approaches. \"Hello,\" she says. \"Do you like kittens?\" \"Hello,\" I answer. \"Kittens are the only innocent creatures in the innocent world, aren't they, because if god exists, or whatever, then god probably made kittens to be innocent and stuff, and that means that kittens are probably the only happy animals in the animal kingdom.\" The cashier sort of nods. \"If you put a kitten in a death-match with a pit-bull, in a cage maybe, a cage-death-match, do you think the kitten's innocence and goodness would slowly defeat the pit-bull until the pit-bull came to love the kitten and lick the kitten all over?\" \"I don't know,\" the cashier says. \"Maybe.\" \"Do you love the kittens?\" The cashier looks at the kittens kind of sadly and I feel her sadness and it makes me also sad and I'm even sorry that I asked her the question but at the same time I really want an answer to this question and it seems like there is nothing more important than the answer to this question about whether or not she loves the kittens, and maybe it will change my life in some kind of meaningful way and it will be scary and sad and I will be nervous for a while but it will be like life is supposed to be and I will look on this moment fondly when I am old and tell people about it randomly, on street corners, probably until I am dead. \"The kittens are nice,\" the cashier says. \"Do you want a kitten?\" I think, 'I want to take a kitten home and throw it at my boyfriend and hit him in his little black eyes and the kitten will open its claws and stick its claws into his little soft face.' \"No,\" I say. \"I don't want a kitten I just want to look at the kittens and think about the kittens' goodness and innocence and stuff like that.\" \"Okay.\" The cashier slowly moves away and is quiet until I can't see her anymore and I am alone with the kittens again. 'I am alone with the kittens,' I think. I am scared. I don't know what to do so I put my hand against the glass case and stare at the kittens and the kittens notice me staring and gather together in the far corner and lay on top of each other and transform into a strange little bundle of fur and eyes. I imagine myself as a little bundle of fur and eyes. I say aloud, \"I am a little bundle of fur and eyes.\" I text-message my boyfriend. I send the words, 'I am fur and eyes.' He doesn't text me back. When the cashier's not looking I steal a kitten. I hide the kitten in my rain-parka and take the kitten outside where it is still raining and I walk down the street near a different AM/PM and put the kitten in a mailbox and close the mailbox. I am afraid again. I run from the mailbox. I think, 'I must get far from this mailbox before they catch me.' I get far from the mailbox and nobody catches me. I think, 'I really want to do something.' I think, 'I don't know what to do.' I call my boyfriend's cell-phone. \"Take me home,\" I say. \"Where are you?\" he asks. I look around. \"I don't know,\" I say. \"I'm somewhere.\" \"Fine,\" he says. I think, 'My boyfriend will find me if I wait long enough.' I go inside a café and order a cup of coffee and wait by the window. The café is full of people and they are noisy and they talk a lot about things I don't really know so I watch outside and the cars and I think, 'I hope that kitten is okay.' There is an empty car parked in front of the café. The empty car is dark and dented some, and the hood doesn't seem to close all the way. I wonder about the car and who might have parked it in front of this café and why it is dented so much until my boyfriend calls me and then I think about stealing the car until I change my mind."

    "text": "my eventual bloodless coup by ofelia hunt / penguins swim around < my eventual bloodless coup / by ofelia hunt > penguins swim around \"I'll take you to the zoo to see the penguins,\" I tell Jackson. Jackson doesn't say anything. We are in my little Honda listening to an NPR broadcast about quantum computers or something and Jackson thinks he wants to be a computer engineer and go to MIT and be a genius and leave Idaho forever so he ignores me and listens to the radio. \"The penguins live in a dirty little pool in the back of the zoo and nobody ever visits them.\" Jackson holds up his hand. The NPR interviewer says something clever and Jackson laughs. I don't laugh. I start my car. At the zoo, I tell Jackson to listen. I say, \"Jackson, the truth is you are half-penguin. Mom never told you because she knew you'd freak out or something and go on a penguin killing spree and be arrested and put in jail until you die.\" Jackson leans over the rail and looks down at the penguins. The penguins swim around in their dirty little pool. The penguins glide through the water swiftly and silently, sometimes hopping out of the water onto their dirty little island and waddling slowly to the other penguins and rubbing the other penguins before plopping back into the dirty water. Jackson looks at the penguins. \"Anyway, your chromosomes were genetically spliced with a penguin's by a doctor at the University of Idaho, the first splicing of its kind, and that's why you're such a good swimmer.\" \"Your chromosomes were genetically spliced with a naval orange by a horticulturist from Seattle, Washington,\" he says. \"Mom never told you because she was afraid you might try to peel yourself and eat your pulpy inside if you knew. But I think you're old enough to trust with this knowledge.\" Jackson stares at my eyes and puts his hand on my shoulder and says, \"'Whatever you do, don't eat yourself.\" We watch the penguins swim around for a while. I lightly punch Jackson in the shoulder and Jackson pretends to be hurt and I pretend to be sad and we both pretend to be sad and then we stop because it is hard to tell if we are still pretending or if we are really sad. I buy Jackson and me an ice-cream cone from the ice-cream cone vendor and we eat ice-cream and watch sloth bears lay around in their rocky enclosure. Jackson turns suddenly and stares away from me. I look where Jackson's looking and I hear shouting and screaming. Jackson runs towards the sounds and I follow Jackson but I think that we shouldn't run towards shouts and screams because shouts and screams usually mean danger and I don't want to face danger but I also don't want Jackson to face danger alone at the zoo. Jackson stops. I stop. I see a man in a mask. The man in the mask holds a knife. The man in the mask holds a zoologist. The zoologist is crying. The man in the mask holds his knife near the zoologists face. \"Stop,\" Jackson yells. The man in the mask waves his knife around. He shouts, \"They spliced my genes. I'm a sloth bear. They spliced my genes.\" \"Its okay,\" Jackson yells. \"We're all mutants.\" The man in the mask waves his knife. \"Admit it,\" he shouts. \"You spliced my genes.\" The zoologist cries harder and moves his head up and down and tries to say, \"Yes.\" The SWAT team takes up position behind the man in the mask and they shoot him with bean bags and tasers and the man in the mask falls to the ground screaming and drops his knife and the SWAT team subdues him and handcuffs him and drags him out of the zoo. The zoologist sits quietly in the grass and looks at his knees. I follow Jackson over to the zoologist. \"Are you okay?\" Jackson asks. \"I'm okay,\" answers the zoologist. I wonder if he really spliced the masked man's genes. \"Do you splice genes?\" I ask. The zoologist cries some more. He stares at his hands and cries and turns away and refuses to look at me and Jackson and after a while Jackson and I walk away. Jackson seems to be walking slowly but I have to run to keep up. \"Wait,\" I say. \"You're going too fast.\" Jackson keeps his pace and I run, and now we are out in the neighborhood near the zoo and it is dark but every house has many lights and these lights are bright and warm and not like the zoo at all. I don't know where I parked my car. I think my car must be far away but I hope that Jackson remembers, but he's still walking too fast and now he's almost a block ahead of me, so I try to run faster and my side hurts and my lungs hurt. \"Wait,\" I tell Jackson. He turns the corner and I run as fast as I can even though my side hurts and I turn the corner and I find Jackson there, sitting on the sidewalk. He is sitting on the sidewalk and holding his knees. I sit next to him and we look at all the houses with all the lights in the neighborhood and I wonder why there are so many lights everywhere and I ask Jackson, but he doesn't know the answer so we sit there some more and we don't say anything and we don't find my car until later when it doesn't matter anymore."

    "text": "my eventual bloodless coup by ofelia hunt / one baby is like any other baby < my eventual bloodless coup / by ofelia hunt > one baby is like any other baby My boyfriend says, \"One baby is like any other baby so who cares what baby you brainwash or whatever?\" I say, \"One car is like any other car.\" We are sitting in my boyfriend's red car at the shopping-mall. The car is new and smells new and the seats are all leather which means some animal's skin was used to make the seats, but they are comfortable anyway, and not sticky. Outside is cold and rainy, so I turn on the radio and push the scan button and go from station to station because all the music is boring and repetitive, or, sometimes, there is no music and only commercials that are boring and repetitive and which make me sad. My boyfriend says, \"Stop that.\" I stop. My boyfriend pushes the scan button and goes from station to station. A little later, the rain stops and we step out of my boyfriend's red car and walk slowly across the parking-lot, toward the shopping-mall. The shopping-mall is a gray behemoth. It is very square and very big and people walk in and out of it in sporadic clumps, some of them smiling and laughing, and others frowning and glaring. My boyfriend and I glare back at these people and these people are quiet when they are near us. We are going to a movie. The movie theater is inside the shopping-mall, next to the food court. \"I hope the movie is a good movie,\" my boyfriend says. \"I hope the movie isn't boring.\" \"We should buy jelly beans before we go into the movie,\" I say. \"If the movie is bad we can throw the jelly beans at the movie screen. We can aim for the lead actor's head. The lead actor is probably Christopher Walken. I don't know if it is Christopher Walken, but if it is, and if the movie is boring, then we can throw jelly beans at Christopher Walken's head, and maybe even the real Christopher Walken, not the Christopher Walken in the movie, but the Christopher Walken who lives in real life, will be at this movie, and if the movie is boring, and if the real Christopher Walken from real life is at the movie, then we can throw jelly beans at him.\" My boyfriend doesn't say anything. Many people walk around the mall in clumps with many bags in their hands or on their arms, some talking, some not. I say, \"Maybe if it's really boring then you can just fuck me on the seat with my legs up in the air and I can scream real loud, or something.\" \"Ssshh,\" my boyfriend says, looking around wildly, \"someone might hear you.\" Inside the movie theater, I have a feeling of immense foreboding, and know that the movie will be boring. The movie starts. It is boring. Christopher Walken is not in the movie, but if he were, it would still be boring. The lead actor, who looks a little like Christopher Walken but is not famous like Christopher Walken, is a hard-boiled cop in New York City and he has to find a killer who leaves clues on each victim. The victims are all young girls and the hard-boiled cop has many emotional outbursts because he is under so much pressure. At the same time, because of the hard-boiled cop's heightened stress level, and the way the hard-boiled cop projects this on his wife and kids, his wife leaves him and takes the kids to Vermont. 'It is inevitable,' I think, 'that the killer will follow the wife and kids and take them hostage, hoping to kill them one by one while the hard-boiled cop frantically searches for them.' I tell my boyfriend, \"It is inevitable the killer will follow the wife and kids to Vermont and take them hostage.\" \"Ssshh,\" my boyfriend says. The killer follows the wife and kids to Vermont and takes them hostage. \"This movie is stupid,\" I say. \"You're stupid,\" my boyfriend says. I slowly walk out of the movie theater and out into the shopping-mall. I look behind me. My boyfriend is not following. I walk out of the shopping-mall and out into the parking-lot. It is gray and boring outside and I glare at everyone and everyone glares back at me and I want very much to talk to my boyfriend but I don't want to go back into the movie theater. 'One movie is like any other movie,' I think. 'Fuck him,' I think. I turn toward a scratchy sound. A car stops. Somebody pulls a canvas sack over my head and pushes me down. I land on something soft. \"Don't talk,\" somebody says. Something slams. I am quiet. The canvas sack is warm and rough and my face itches. \"Don't talk,\" somebody says. I am in a car. I can feel it moving. We are driving somewhere, away from the mall, and I am scared and quiet, and I wonder if my boyfriend will search for me like the hard-boiled cop in the movie and if we are going to Vermont, which isn't likely, because we're in Idaho and Vermont is very far from Idaho. I want to be watching a boring movie with my boyfriend, a movie like any other movie, in a movie theater like any other movie theater, and lean my head against my boyfriend's shoulder which is like any other shoulder, and feel tired and warm, and not afraid, because now I'm very afraid, and very cold, and the car is moving very fast now, I can feel it, and I am suddenly tired and lonely and hungry all at once. The car stops. I am pulled from the car. I fall to the ground. I roll on the ground, which is gravelly, and feel the gravel scratch my arms. Someone pulls the sack from head. I sit on the gravel with my palms in the gravel and look up at a man with a mask and gun. \"Don't talk,\" he says, and walks slowly toward his car. The car is black and the windows are tinted. He shuts the rear passenger door. He leans against the car. He seems very tall and very fat, but he is actually short and skinny and dressed all in black. \"Don't talk,\" he says again, and taps his gun against his thigh. I wonder if he will shoot me. The man takes off his mask. He is old and white. He says, \"One hostage is like any other hostage and I should shoot you or something.\" I don't say anything. \"Take off your shirt,\" he says. I start to take off my shirt. \"Stop,\" he says. \"I didn't mean that. I don't know why I said that. Sometimes I just say things. I don't know how not to say things.\" He sets his gun on his car. \"Look,\" he says, \"I don't know why I kidnapped you. I think you wanted to be kidnapped or something and I sensed that and so I did it, and now I think you want to be killed and I am sensing that and I don't really want to kill you right now, but if you really want me to, and I keep sensing that, then I'll have to shoot you and bury you or something.\" \"I didn't want to be kidnapped,\" I say. \"Yes you did. I sensed it.\" \"You must be very empathetic.\" \"I am very empathetic. That's how I sensed your desire to be kidnapped and how I'm sensing your desire to be shot in the face with my gun.\" \"Oh,\" I say. The man holds his gun. The man points his gun at my face. The man shoots me in the face with his gun. The man drives his car away. Everything is okay. The gun didn't hurt me because it was like any other gun and no gun can really hurt me, I think, and I wonder when my boyfriend will find me because I don't know where I am or how to get back to the mall from here and it is dark and cold and I want to be at my apartment which is like any other apartment and I want to watch television commercials and lean against my boyfriend's shoulder and nap quietly for a while and wake up and walk to AM/PM and eat some ice-cream."

    "text": "my eventual bloodless coup by ofelia hunt / the room is full of me < my eventual bloodless coup / by ofelia hunt the room is full of me I think, 'This room is very white and very cold and if I were an interior decorator I would probably paint the walls strangely and at angles so that people would walk strangely and at angles, and maybe approach very slowly or very quickly, or approach quickly but take a very a long time, or approach slowly but arrive in a moment or something, and I say, \"I am somebody.\" \"What?\" Chris asks. Chris removes his eyeglasses and stares at me because he wants to look intelligent. I say, \"The yellow elephant reprogrammed nineteen death robots in Sidney, Australia.\" I step away from Chris at an angle and walk very slowly toward the bathroom, yet I am moving swiftly and though Chris jogs to keep up, I quickly outdistance him. \"Wait!\" Chris says. \"Where are you going?\" I could say many things now. I could say, 'I will strangle small animals in the garden' or 'I need to check my e-mail' or 'I'm going to invent a machine that can replace humans in any workplace and really fuck up the economy,' or 'I need to steal a candy bar,' or 'I'm going to poison your mother,' or 'It's time for me to turn some tricks or something.' This is not a complete list. There are many other things could say. I say, \"There are many other things I could say.\" Chris says, \"I don't understand.\" Chris flanks me, walking very slowly, and cuts me off. Chris says, \"It's okay. You can stay here with me.\" He tries to hold my hand and hug me but I don't want him to hug me so I sort of shrink away from his hands and I do this very slowly which moves me quickly away from Chris and Chris's hands. Chris says, \"What's wrong?\" I hate the question, 'What's wrong?' I think, 'I will fillet the question 'What's wrong?' with a knife for filleting fish and I will pan-fry the question 'What's wrong?' in vegetable oil over medium heat for two decades and then serve the question 'What's wrong?' to a lunchroom of prison rapists or something.' I tell all of this to Chris. \"Oh,\" Chris says. I have said the wrong thing. I think, 'This room is very white and very cold and there are too many people and these too many people should be herded carefully outside and into the parking-lot and into their own cars and their cars should be herded someplace else, like a Denny's, and then I could wait here in this very white very cold room and I could tell Chris that he should also go to the Denny's and I could think about redecorating for a while and the colors at strange angles and other things.' The priest approaches Chris and me strangely and at odd angles and so slowly that he appears suddenly at our side. The priest has this sort of monstrously curved brow lined up and down with thick hair and he directs this brow at Chris and me and we are both shocked in a way because the brow is sort of weird and maybe lurid and it makes you want to stare but you know you shouldn't stare but you do it anyway. The priest says, \"I'm sorry.\" \"Oh,\" I say. The priest has said the wrong thing. I go into the bathroom. Chris doesn't follow me into the bathroom. The bathroom is a little room and it is comfortable and very much like a cocoon, but bright and with tiles and one toilet and one sink. I turn on the sink. I flush the toilet. \"I'm sorry,\" I say to the sink. \"I'm sorry,\" I say to the toilet. \"I used you both for many years,\" I say, \"and I never thanked you at all and you gave me so much cool and comfortable water which is really something that I shouldn't have expected so easily. In history people had to go to the water, but you bring it to me and take it away from me and stuff.\" I sit on the toilet. I flush the toilet again. There is a faint knock on the bathroom door. \"I'm sorry bathroom door,\" I say to the bathroom door. \"Chris doesn't know how much that hurts.\" I stand on the toilet seat. \"I'm sorry toilet seat,\" I say. I look out the narrow window to the parking-lot and watch the shiny shoes of old men as they move up and then down and then to the side. I hear tapping on the bathroom door again. \"What?\" I ask. I hear some muffled words. \"I'm coming,\" I say. I open the door and I look up at Chris and Chris's little black eyes as Chris's little black eyes look at my little pale face. \"Your shoes aren't shiny,\" I say. \"What?\" Chris asks. \"It doesn't matter anyway,\" I say. \"It's okay.\" Chris is scratching his eye and he is not being careful and it is a little scary because he could scratch his eye badly and he could go blind and then he would never watch television again and he likes to watch television, which is really tragic actually and I think, 'I have to stop him from going blind.' I say, \"Don't go blind Chris, you will go blind if you keep scratching your eye.\" \"Huh?\" Chris says. \"I'm sorry Chris,\" I say. \"I'm terrible and terribly mean to you.\" I think, 'I should destroy this white room and remake this white room so that everyone in this white room can feel happy and energetic and so that Chris can sit comfortably and not stand next to me and not worry about what I might say at every moment.' I think, 'I should be disqualified as a human being.' I feel alternately like an alien and like a robot, and I also feel like I can't talk to Chris anymore because I can't. \"I am disqualified,\" I say to Chris. I go outside. I apologize to my little Honda. \"I'm disqualified,\" I say. At the grocery store, I tell the grocery clerk. \"Your money's still good here,\" the grocery clerk says. At the park, I tell a small girl. \"You're funny,\" the little girl says. When I type it to some guy I don't know in Australia, he types back that he's disqualified too. He types, 'We should have crazy disqualified sex in my camper.' I type back, 'I am a hermaphrodite.' He types back, 'Oh.' I am not a hermaphrodite. I call Chris with my cell-phone and I leave him a long message about being disqualified and also to apologize for being weird earlier and I hang up, but then I feel nervous about the message because I think I probably said the wrong thing and I don't want Chris to hear the message because he will think I am strange and awkward. I drive my little Honda to Chris's apartment and I sneak into Chris's apartment through the window and I search Chris's apartment for his cell-phone but I don't find his cell-phone and instead I feel dizzy because his walls aren't quite straight and his floor isn't quite level and his furniture is colorful and strangely angled. I feel a little sick. I lay on Chris's couch. I take a nap. Chris wakes me up. He's just come home from work. Chris says, \"What are you doing here?\" \"I don't know,\" I say. \"Trying to become requalified,\" I say. I don't mean it. I think, 'I should redecorate this apartment, I should destroy this apartment and create this apartment and redecorate it.' I think, 'I should destroy Chris and create Chris and redecorate Chris.' I say to Chris, \"I will destroy you.\" \"Go ahead,\" Chris says."

    "text": "THE LIVING AND THE DEAD | twenty THE LIVING AND THE DEADby Noah Cicero + > twenty In the bar of the strip club. Dave, the bartender, Frankie, Layla, and Esmeralda are all sitting. Nothing is going on; it is the beginning of the night. Esmeralda walks over to the pole to practice. She does some tricks. She looks beautiful. She smiles while doing them. Esmeralda hangs upside down and slaps her own ass cheeks with her hands. Then suddenly!!! Five of the undead burst through the door. One of the undead scream, “Humans must die!” One zombie charges Layla! Layla grabs the knife used to cut lemons and stabs the zombie in the head. The stumbles back but doesn’t die. Three of them charge the stage! Esmeralda’s face has a look of terror. They charge her! She jumps up on the pole and swings around. When one of them gets close enough she kicks them in the skull with her stiletto heel! The zombies do not die, but they are stunned. One fights with Dave. Dave is about to be bitten and Frankie shoots it with his gun. Esmeralda yells, “Hold on, I’m gonna go get my machete!” Esmeralda runs downstairs. She runs into the dressing room. Opens up her bag, takes out a machete and sprints upstairs. Everyone is still fighting with the zombies. Frankie keeps shooting one of them. Dave keeps punching one of them. Layla is breaking beer bottles and stabbing them. Esmeralda comes upstairs, chops off undead heads! Blood everywhere! Intestines flop on the floor! Brain matter ooze! A pancreas flies across the room! She cuts each of their heads off one after another! A large intestine slithers on the floor like a snake. The heads are mumbling. Fingers crawl on the ground like caterpillars. Esmeralda says, “Fuck their body parts are still moving!” “Grab the parts and throw them out the door.” Everyone runs over and grabs the parts, then races to the door and throws them out. After the parts are thrown out everyone stands around looking insane. Their faces are contorted into a terrible look of horror. They are shaking. “What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck!” Layla screams. “Shut the fuck up! Wait, isn’t there another one. I’m sure I saw another one come in.” A chewing type sound is heard from behind the bar. Frankie motions to everyone to be quiet with his index finger. He then proceeds to slowly look over the bar. He sees that one of those things is eating the bartender. He points his gun at it. He motions to Esmeralda that it is behind the bar. Esmeralda jumps over the bar and chops its head off. She throws the other people the parts from behind the bar to the other people like workers on a sandbag barricade during a flood. Suddenly the bathroom door opens and a dancer walks out. She is in a comatose. Frankie sees her and shoots. The dancer gets shot in the head. Then quietly dies. “Holy shit, you fucker. That’s Ambrosia. She’s an oxie addict not a zombie!” Yells Esmeralda. ‘I’m sorry. She fucking looks like one of those things.” “That’s fine. She was an idiot anyway.” “Yeah, that bitch is better off dead. I know I won’t miss her.” Says Layla. They sit down at the bar. Esmeralda says, “Somebody better lock the fucking door before anymore of those bitches gets in here.” Everyone is sitting around drinking from a bottle trying to calm down. “What the fuck are those things?” Says Frankie. “They looked dead to me. They looked pale, they moved awkwardly, and they smelled like hell. One time I was walking around the eastside and found a dead crack head in an abandoned house and it smelled just like that.” “But it talked. It said, ‘Humans must die.’” Says Frankie. “We are safe here though. This is a strip club so no windows. There is no way to get in here. And the doors are three inch thick metal. This place is a fucking fortress. There’s a week worth of food in the kitchen. And a good amount of booze left by the regulars. So we might be able to survive,” says Esmeralda. “I don’t think we will be in here for than a couple of hours. The American government is for sure going to take care of this. Our country is the greatest country in the world. They would never let anything bad happen to us,” says Dave. “Our country would never let anything bad happen to us? Are you fucking stupid? Are you? Are you fucking stupid?” Says Frankie sarcastically. “America is the greatest country on earth. Everyone knows that. That’s why people come here,” says Dave. “Shut up skeezer fuck head!” Says Esmeralda. “Lets turn on the radio and see if they have anything to say,” says Layla. “I’ll go and get it,” says Esmeralda. Esmeralda runs downstairs to get it. While they wait. Thoughts circulate through their heads at a high speed. So quickly do the thoughts come, they collide together and make no sense. They know something bad has happened. Something very horrible has gone down. They know people they are related to and their friends might be dead. They know it doesn’t make sense that the dead are walking. They know they didn’t like shooting and chopping up the dead people. They aren’t sure why they were attacking them. What has happened they think. Why has this happened to me they think. Why, in their life, during their period of existence in a certain span of history in a certain location did something so horrible happen. They know too, they might die. That perhaps, their hours are numbered. No one speaks. Everyone is trying to realize the implications of this event. The magnitude of shit that has just been dropped on their heads. The dead have risen to kill the living. How does one even rationalize that? All they know. Is that the dead are trying to kill the living. That is a fact, that is empirical. They don’t need to know anymore. They know they must remain alive. They know that it is better to be alive, then to be undead, or whatever those things are. Esmeralda brings back the radio. Places it on the bar and plugs it in. The radio plays. It is Katie Couric. Katie Couric says, “There is a zombie invasion. Zombies are all over the Youngstown area attacking living humans. Be very cautious of them. There is no way to kill them. You have chopped them up into little bits and light them on fire. I have received a message from your congressman to play for you.” The Congressman says, “Do not worry citizens of Youngstown. The zombies will soon be killed and you will be able to return to your way of life, of drinking, doing narcotics, having promiscuous sex, giving birth to illegitimate babies, collecting well-fare, working your ass for five fifteen an hour, and hating yourself. All these aspects of your life will return. But we must stay alert. Do not approach the undead. I’ve heard that several tree hugger hippies have thought it a good idea to try to make friends with the undead. It will not work, no matter how you talk to them about Ghandi and pacifism they will bite you. Do not fuck with zombies! I repeat, don’t fuck with the zombies. Thank you, your congressman.” Katie Couric returns, “Market professionals have phoned me to tell the public not to worry. Things will be better after the undead invasion because a lot of the undead had jobs; even some zombies had jobs with health care. And that since those humans have become zombies. Those jobs will open up. So don’t fret. This will have a happy ending after all.” Everyone looks very confused by the announcement. Layla gets up and starts breaking shit. She breaks bottles and throws chair. She’s crying badly and says, “This is fucking bullshit. This is fucking bullshit! I can’t stand being alive! Humans fucking suck bad enough! And now even the dead ones suck. This is so fucking stupid! Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!” Layla sits down the floor, puts her head in her arms and cries. Esmeralda goes over and sits next to her and comforts her. “Don’t worry ladies I’ll take care of you. I’m a trained marine. I was trained to fight in a war, and what we got here is a fucking war. But I’m okay. I’m not scared. I’ll fight every one of these undead fucks bare handed if I have to, to protect you ladies,” says Dave. “That dead motherfucker was about to kill you if I didn’t shoot it. Are you fucking retarded?” Says Frankie laughing. “Shut up. Just shut up. Don’t worry the marines will be here soon,” Says Dave. “The marines are coming to save two strippers, a black man, and a white trash skeezer. They’re gonna save the rich people first. Hell Youngstown is the last thing on their agenda,” says Frankie. “No, the marines will be here soon,” says Dave. “From the floor Layla screams, “Shut up skeezer!” “We need to calm down. Okay, we need to calm down. What is everybody’s name? And tell a little about yourself. Because if we gonna be trapped in this strip club for awhile we should get to know each other.” “My name is Frankie. I grew up in Youngstown on the south side. My dad left us when I was four. My mom and grandma raised me. I still live on the south side. I have no wife or kids. My favorite foods are mozzarella sticks and cheeseburgers. I like to put barbecue sauce on my cheeseburgers. I’m in my junior year of biology at YSU. And I like to sprint race my 87 Monte Carlo at the track.” “My name is Layla. I have one ten year old. I have two brothers; one is drunk all the time. The other one is the pen. My baby’s daddy is also in the pen. My mother won’t speak to me because I robbed her house. My favorite thing to do is ride roller coasters. I like to swim and like riding four wheelers.” “Hmm. My name is Dave. I was in the marines.” “What was your job and be fucking honest. I don’t believe you were special forces,” says Frankie. ‘Hmm, cook. All right I was a fucking cook.” Everybody laughs. “You were a fucking cook,” says Esmeralda. “Shut up!” Dave yells. “Whatever skeezer, keep going,” says Layla. “I live with my mom. I take care of her and pay the bills. I like to read Tom Clancy novels.” “Tom Clancy sucks,” says Esmeralda. “Tom Clancy rules! Shut up. My favorite thing to eat is pulled pork and carny fries. And I’m a virgin and ladies I don’t want to die being one.” “In hell,” says Layla. “I guess it’s my turn. I have a six year old. I spent most of my childhood in foster care. My mom is a crack head. Don’t know who my dad is. Neither does my mom. It can be assumed I’m a trick baby. My favorite styles of music are rap and country. My favorite foods are chili dogs and candy apples. I’ll eat a steak when I got the money. I had a dream of owning a bar but I don’t think enough people are going to be alive to go to it now.” “All right, so we all know each other. What are we supposed to do now?” Says Layla. “Not die,” says Frankie. There is a noise from behind the bar. The bartender stands up looking insane and vicious. “Fuck, she’s one of them!” Yells Esmeralda. The bartender jumps on the bar, jumps at Dave. Dave punches her in the face. She flies on the floor. Esmeralda runs over, cuts her head off. They throw the body outside. “I guess we shouldn’t let those mother fuckers bite us,” says Frankie. “I guess not,” says Esmeralda. + >"

    "text": "THE LIVING AND THE DEAD | twenty-one THE LIVING AND THE DEADby Noah Cicero < + > twenty-one Preacher Elmer and five other of the undead are standing outside of a house. They are hiding behind bushes. Preacher Elmer looks at them and says, “Inside that house is the leader of the conspiracy to wipe out zombies. He lives for one thing, the complete destruction of the undead way of life. He hates the undead. He despises us. He is evil. Evil! We must go in there and eat him; we must not even let him become the undead. We must eat him until there is nothing left.” A long haired hippy is sitting on his couch eating chips and watching the news. The zombies burst into the room. The long haired hippy says in a panic, “Don’t. You don’t have to do this. We can resolve this peacefully. Isn’t there still some human left in you? Deep inside, there has to be some of that living human in you. That part of you with a living human soul. You might be dead, but you’re still human.” Preacher Elmer says, “Listen hippy. This is America right?” “Yeah.” “And in America you have democracy?” “Yeah.” “Is not the bulk of the American population undead now?” “Well, I guess it is.” “Is that not the majority?” “Yeah.” “Aren’t the rules of democracy say that if the bulk have voted for a certain way of life, a certain candidate, a certain proposal, that it must be that way.” “Yeah.” “Well, we have the bulk of the population. This is the new way of life.” “So our new way of life is murder?” “Yes.” “Can we agree to disagree,” says the hippy. “Yes.” “Are you still going to kill me?” “Yes, in a democracy anyone can have an opinion. Just some of them you can be killed for having,” says Preacher Elmer. “That’s not how it works.” “Oh yes it does. If you steal, you hold the opinion it is okay to take other people’s shit without paying for it correct?” “Yeah, I guess.” “Your opinion like stealing is against the law now. And the punishment for your opinion is death. Eat him boys!” “No!!!” They eat the tree hugger. < + >"

    "text": "THE LIVING AND THE DEAD | twenty-two THE LIVING AND THE DEADby Noah Cicero < + > twenty-two Five days into the invasion. Everyone is sitting around the bar doing nothing. The radio stops playing music, gives an update. Katie Couric says, “The undead have destroyed the police force. The military that is left in the United States has been destroyed also. The public has asked the government to bring back the troops stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Germany, Italy, and Japan. The President has denied that request stating that, “All the rich white Protestants have been taken to a safe island in the South Pacific. And they are all right and there is no need to worry. The troops need to stay in those locations to protect our economic interests. And they would probably just end up being killed anyway. Thank you. Godspeed.” The death toll for America is estimated at 80 percent of the population. The top ten percent richest have all left the country. So that only leaves ten percent remaining alive. To the remaining ten percent that remains alive. It would probably be a good idea right now to kill yourself.” “We’re fucked. We will drown under these circumstances, says Esmeralda. “Don’t worry this is America. This can’t happen here,” says Dave. “Weren’t you listening you skeezer fuck?” Says Esmeralda. “Our families our probably dead. We will be dead soon,” says Layla beginning to cry. “I need to be by myself,” says Esmeralda grabbing a bottle of vodka and heading to the basement. Esmeralda goes into the dressing room. She takes a big drink from the bottle. She sticks her hand into panties and rubs herself. All she can do is jack off to relieve any of the tension in her body. Her muscles are taut, she must calm down somehow. Layla sits in one of the lapdance rooms. She sits on a couch and cuts little slits in her skin. She writes the word ‘undead’ on her skin. Blood flows out of her. The pain feels good. She smiles. Frankie is in the shower. He cries while holding his penis. Dave is sitting at the bar looking at a picture of his mother. Life is passing slowly. The undead are still outside. There is no escape. This strip club could be where they die. They will not get to work their thirty years at some shitty job. They will not get to retire from that shitty job. They will not get retirement in Florida in an old person’s community. They will not get to die and get a funeral with their families. None of that. They will die meaninglessly in a strip club with three other people they don’t even know. When Frankie gets out the shower he notices a pretty stripper robe that is laying nearby. He puts it on. It makes him feel sexy. And when he feels sexy he feels calm. That is what he needs most now. Esmeralda is fingering herself and something occurs to her, “If they are dead, they are decomposing. That means they’re being eaten by maggots. I got it, I got it.” Esmeralda and yells, “Hey everybody! Come in here I got an idea. I have an idea how we can beat the zombies. I got it. Get the fuck in here!” Layla comes rushing in.. “What the fuck happened to your leg?” Says Esmeralda to Layla. “Nothing.” “There are cuts all over it.” “When I get stressed out I cut myself. All right. Leave me alone.” “Go get some band aids.” “Okay.” She walks behind the bar to get some band aids. Frankie comes upstairs. He is wearing the outfit he was looking at downstairs. “What the fuck are you wearing?” Says Esmeralda. “A pretty outfit.” “Why?” “It calms me down to wear women’s clothing.” “Fuck, you’re both nuts. Dave what were you doing while we were separated?” They all look at him. He’s crying holding his mother’s photo. “Fucking hell!” “Well, what is the idea?” “Here it is. I realized that they are dead. Which means they are decaying. And from what we’ve seen they are decaying. But I’m not sure how fast a human decomposes.” “I think it takes about fifty days for sure. But since they make some more zombies everyday, it could be another three months before they are all rotted away.” “So all we gotta do is wait fifty days?” “Yeah, but we might starve to death by then. We need to accelerate the process.” “Like what, build giant maggots,” says Layla jokingly, “Yeah, that’s it. We could do it. When I was in college I read a paper about giant insects. That back in the day there used to be giant insects when there was more oxygen in the air. And that scientists have figured out how to get them giant again. But couldn’t do it because of regulations by PETA. But it explained how in the article. It basically said you need to splice the cells of a mammal’s lung with theirs and it could work.” “We don’t have a lab here. So what the fuck are we gonna do?” Says Esmeralda. “I have lab equipment at my house. Not really lab equipment, but shit to cook crystal meth with. It was my cousin’s. He gave it to me to hold while he was spending time in county for six months. He’s probably one of the undead now so I don’t think he will care.” There are gunshots outside. It sounds like an automatic weapon. Everybody looks up. “Somebody is out there. Somebody open the door,” says Layla. Esmeralda grabs her machete, walks to the door. Everybody follows behind her. A frantic knocking on the door. From behind the door a voice is yelling, “Hello, is anyone in there? I’m human! I’m not dead yet! Please let me in!” He continues yelling while they are talking. Esmeralda whispers, “What do you all think we should do?” “Let him in, he probably has guns. And that’s what we are gonna need to get to the meth lab,” says Layla. “Yeah, let him in. Those things can’t fire guns. Their fingers are too stiff,” says Frankie. Everyone gets a weapon. Frankie has his gun. Layla has a small knife. Dave has his buck knife. Esmeralda opens the door. Tony runs into the bar. He sits down at the bar. He grabs the nearest bottle and takes a good swig. He is panting. He looks tired and beaten. He is unshaved, looks mean. He has a bag with him. “Who the fuck are you?” Says Esmeralda. “Tony Tanferno.” “How’s it going out there?” “It’s hell.” “Do you need any food?” “No, I need booze and then some sleep. Have yous been in here the whole time?” “Yeah. Since the beginning.” “It holds them out good?” Says Tony. “Yeah. No windows and metal doors.” “This happened before.” “What?” “In the sixties. It was small then. They were killed before even ten were made. If you put a dead body into the Mahoning River, it comes back. There’s something in the river, some kind of a concoction of chemicals that mixed together, that does it.” “Are you fucking serious?” “Yeah. I’m going to go to sleep. This is a strip club, so where are the couches?” “Before you go to sleep do you have guns in that bag?” “Yeah, lots of them. Here look. Show me where I can sleep?” Layla takes him downstairs. Frankie and Esmeralda unzip the bag, look in. It is full of guns and bullets. “All right. Now we have the shit to get to your house. My car is outside. It should get us there quickly. How close do you live?” Says Esmeralda. “About ten minutes away.” “You have any canned goods there?” “A good amount we can grab. Got a bunch of Ramon Noodles.” “Sounds good. Tomorrow we do it.” < + >"

We’re gonna go get Frankie’s lab equipment and some food. We need someone to stay so the can open the door when we get back. So Layla you stay here,” says Esmeralda. “Okay, I’ll stay by the door,” says Layla. Everyone gets a gun but Esmeralda. She sticks with the machete. “Listen you can’t kill them with a bullets. So just shoot them in the knees or shoot their heads off. Their heads will fly off. And they won’t be able to see. They are very slow and stupid. They will say things though. Don’t listen to them, they are full of shit.” They go out the door. There are stinky ass dead people everywhere. Tony shoots some in the neck. Their heads fly off and bounce on the ground. Frankie shoots them the knee caps. He likes to see them stumble then fall. Esmeralda hacks one of their heads off. There are body parts scattered all over the parking lot. They get in Esmeralda’s hoopty. The parking lot is bumpy with body parts. The undead are all over the road. Old women wearing Sunday dresses stagger, maggots eating their eyeballs, missing an arm. Hot cheerleaders in their panties, their young firm tits decomposed. Upper class businessmen wearing ties, their penises have fallen off. They keep grabbing at their crotch wondering where their cocks are. Mechanics are eating their wives on the sidewalks. The wives keep yelling, “I never loved you.” Small children are lynching each other for fun. The children dangle giggling singing Britney Spears songs. There is nobody there. They slowly go into the house. They don’t see anybody in the kitchen. They arrive at the house. There are more of the undead. They are shot and chopped up. They enter the house. Frankie and Esmeralda go in the basement to retrieve the shit. Dave and Tony are left upstairs. They hear something in the living room. They slowly sneak into the living room. There is a lot of silent tension. They run into the living room, point their guns. The crack head that bought some crack off of Frankie is sitting on his couch almost fully decomposed. He cannot move, he is the final stages of decomposition. The crack head says, “What you want mother fuckers? You act like you’ve never seen a man almost completely decomposed before.” Tony and Dave stare at him with weird freaked out looks on their faces. The crack head gives a slow very emotional monologue, “When I was four they sent my mother to the mental ward. And my dad was already in the pen for killing the neighbor. So they sent me to my grandpa’s house. I used to sit on the porch with him in the summer and we would drink Dago Red together. He would pour me a big glass. I would sit there and drink until I fell off that goddamn porch. My grandpa would laugh and tell me about when he fought in the South Pacific.\" Daves yells at him, “Shut up crack head! What do you think we should do with him Tony?” “I don’t know. Shoot his mouth off.” “Wait, can’t I have a last request.” “Bitch, this is war.” Dave walks up to him. Places the gun on his decomposing mouth. Fires. His mouth flies across the room and hits the wall. It splats on the wall like a tomato. Frankie and Esmeralda in the basement. They walk for a little bit in the basement and go up to a box. Frankie flips the lid off and sees that the equipment is in there. They do all this in silence. Then Frankie picks it up and they run upstairs. They are all standing in the kitchen. “What was that shot?” Says Esmeralda. “Don’t worry. We shot it,” says Tony. They head outside to the bar. A dead person jumps on Tony and bites him. Esmeralda slices the zombie’s head off. Tony lays on the ground. His face contorts into frenzied manic hell. He looks pissed and in a panic. Tony says in a very pained voice, “The fuckers got me. They fucking got me. This is bullshit. I can’t die like this. I fought so hard, only to die like this. This is what a man gets at the end. He gets turned into a fucking undead fuck head. This is bullshit.” The others stand there and stare at him. “He’s going to turn.” “I know,” says Esmeralda. ‘Do you want me to shoot him?” Says Frankie. Tony holds his wound. Tony says frantically, “Kill me you pussies! I’m the enemy now. I’m the undead. I’m not a man now. I’m not even human. I’m a freak. I’m dead. You must kill me, I’m the enemy. I am treasonous to the cause. I am Benedict Arnold, I must be executed. This is war! Shoot me you coward! Kill me while I’m still a man!” Esmeralda cuts his head off. They stare down at his body. Everyone gets in the car disconcerted. They don’t like that Tony died. They didn’t really know Tony. Tony is dead now. They have to deal with it. Everyone they know is dead. They must deal with these facts. Tony’s death symbolizes their own death. Perhaps they will be bitten too. They imagine their deaths. They know it is coming. It has to come. They don’t quit though. They know suffering. Suffering is the fruit of human existence. They get back in the bar, head back the strip club. When they get out Dave’s mother is there, undead, walking around in a torn nightgown with maggots coming out of several gashes in her body. Dave sees her. He looks like he is going to cry. Dave runs over to her. He stands in front of her. Dave’s mom says, “I knew you would be here you filthy boy! I knew you would be here with these floozies. You are such a dirty boy, a dirty nasty boy. How could you do this to your poor mother?” “I’m sorry mommy,” says Dave pathetically crying. “You better fucking be! Now come here and give your mom a kiss.” Esmeralda yells at Dave, “Don’t Dave, she’ll bite you.” Dave looks at Esmeralda. Then he looks at his mom. Dave is desperately trying to think. But he is having a terrible time. Dave thinks about when he was little and his mother jammed a giant piece of ham in his mouth. How he almost choked on the ham and died. Dave says, “It’s my mom. I love her.” “That’s right boy. Come over here and give your mom a great big kiss.” “Dave if you over there I’ll cut both of your fucking heads off!” Dave’s mother says, “Don’t you touch my boy! Kill her Dave. She’s a floozie bitch. She should die, she’s a sinner.” “Don’t Dave. I’ll kill you.” Dave is trying to make a choice. He looks deep into the abyss of his mind to find a location where there is a set of directions on how to make a good choice. But there isn’t. There are razor wire fences, guards with machine guns, watch towers, rifles sighted on his forehead. No area of his mind was left untouched by the incessant bitching of his mother and 8 o’clock sitcoms. Dave’s mom says, “Dave, she’s a floozie whore bitch. I’m your mother, I love you. I would never bit you. You know that. I love you, I’m your mother.” “I know mommy.” Dave goes closer to her. His mother grabs him and bites him. “Mommy you fucking bit me,” says Dave surprised. Dave stands there. He is crying. His mother is laughing hysterically. Dave is standing with his back to them. He lifts up his gun. There is silence. There are close ups of sweaty faces. Then he shoots his mother. “Fucking bitch!” Then he lifts up the gun, puts it in his mouth and fires. Esmeralda and Frankie just stand there paralyzed. “Dave was stupid. But he didn’t deserve that,” says Frankie. “No. His mother did though.” “You could say that again.” Esmeralda runs over and cuts his head off. < + >"

Andre is a big dude. He looks mean. Little Frankie, looked very small and well, cute, next to Frankie. They are in the automotive section looking at parts. Andrew is looking for new wrenches. A white male store manager keeps looking at them. He is bald and ugly. His shirt is tucked in; his pants are pulled up to his belly button. He follows them around the store. Andre gets angrier and angrier. Andrew turns quickly, looks at the white male store manager. The clerk looks away. Andrew walks up him. Andre says, “Do you want to pat me down mother fucker?” The man says, “What are you talking about sir?” He said, “I said, you wanna pat me down mother fucker?” “Sir you better leave the store.” Andre looks around, “I notice you’re store got like ten employees in it.” “Yeah.” “I don’t see one black person.” “No blacks applied.” “This area is 40 percent blacks, and you’re telling me no blacks applied.” “No, none did.” “You know, I bet you one of those mother fuckers that say, ‘black people are all on well fare.’ But mother fucker if you don’t give black people jobs how are we going to get off well fare and have money to stop stealing shit? You blame us for shit that is your fucking fault.” “Listen, I know about you people. You steal. So get out of my store!” Andre hits the white man. Andre’s huge fist shatters his jaw. There is a crunching sound. Frankie stands there paralyzed. The white man hits the ground. Andre kicks his face and stomps on his ribs. There are more cracking and crunching type sounds. Five white employees rush over. Andrew punches them. Kicks them. They can’t take him down. Security runs over, he hits him too. They mace him eventually. It took ten white people total to get Andre to give up. Frankie watched all of it. < + >"

We have been voted in through a fair election. Since there are about five million living humans left in America it was an easy election to win. And well, there were no human candidates. To the living people of America: My army of the undead are going to find you. We are going to make you undead. We are going to fuck up your shit! We are watching you right now. We have your phones tapped. We have cameras on every street, in every store, everywhere watching your detestable living human bodies. The time is nigh you mother fuckers, soon you will be undead. You have a choice; if you join us freely and come out of your hiding places we will gently bite you. If you decide to remain hidden, we will bite your faces off, rip your jaws out and stick dynamite up your asses and blow you up. We own everything now. The radio will only play Christian punk. There will be only one store in every town, called Undead Mart, which I will own personally. It will supply all of your undead needs like alarm clocks, dishwashers, above ground pools.

I need cells from a mammal’s lungs. If I could get a mammal’s lung’s cells then I could splice it with the maggot cells. Which would cause the lungs to enlarge.” “Where could we get that?” “I think from one of the undead.” “Are you serious?” “Yeah, we have to get one and bring it down here and then cut out a piece of its lungs.” “But isn’t their cells dead?” “If you get a fresh one, the cells won’t be completely dead. And I’m assuming that whatever is making them come back from the dead has something fucked up about it that might help the transformation process in the maggot DNA.” “Ah fuck, we all gonna die.” “We can do it.

They walk slowly, very military navy seal like around the building. They get to the back of the building and see a zombie. The zombie is a cute girl in her panties. Layla and Esmeralda stop at the side of the building. Esmeralda is holding rope. “All right, you ready?” “Yeah, lets fucking do it.” They run out at the zombie. A dead person turns to look at them. Layla kicks at its legs. The undead human falls over. Esmeralda puts a noose around its neck, then ties the feet, hands, neck all together with one rope behind its back. They drag the undead human to the front of the building. When they go around the building this time two of the undead are there. They attack them. One is huge and attacks Esmeralda. There is a long struggle but Esmeralda eventually cuts its head off. The other is still fighting with Layla. Layla gets bit. She stands back from it, stares at her hand. Layla screams at the zombie who bit her, “You mother fucker, I’ll kill you now!” Layla pulls out her gun and fires into the zombie’s face repeatedly until its head is completely blown off. Layla looks at Esmeralda, “I’m bit. I’m fucking bit. I’m going to die. I’m going to die. This is it. Soon I will be one of them. One of those fucking monsters.

I was gonna open my own beauty parlor. Maybe buy a nice car and a dirt bike for my boy. I’ve lived such a shitty life. I don’t think I ever had a good day. I ain’t never had anything nice. And this is how it all ends, here in this parking lot late at night bitten by a fucking zombie. Knowing that it was meaningless. That my life was shit, that I graduated high school to only become undead. What is this shit? What is this?” Esmeralda says, “Layla I don’t know. I’m sorry, but I have to go.” Esmeralda drags the body away. Layla sits on the ground freaking out. Layla says to nothing, “So this is life. So this is what it is all about.

The undead girl growls a little bit. The undead girl says, “You fucking assholes what makes you think you have the right to not become one of us. We are the majority. What makes you so special that you think you don’t deserve to be undead? You think we want to be like this? You think this is fun? You are betraying your families and friends by remaining alive! Everyone you know is undead now. And by not choosing to become undead yourselves you are treasonous and unpatriotic. America is an undead free state now. You are anti-America. You are against your own people. You should be sent to Europe with the living.” Frankie shoots its mouth off. Frankie drags it downstairs. Frankie goes over to the undead girl. Esmeralda is holding it down. He cuts open its chest and rips out a piece of its lung. Frankie takes the piece, sits down at the table where the lab equipment is. He plays with it very scientifically. Esmeralda sits down next to the table. “How long is it going to take?” Says Esmeralda. “No more than two days for it to grow. I’m going to grow a couple and then they will multiple on their own.” “Do you think it will work?” “I don’t know. I hope so.” “I read once that 74,000 years ago there was a Super Volcano in Sumatra it killed most of the human population. Almost made us extinct. And I think of other things like, Polio, the influenza, the black plague, all kinds of shit. Humans have almost been wiped a million times. Maybe it is time. In thirty years global warming will make the waters rise and kill us off anyway. Why not end it now?” Frankie lights a cigarette, takes random swigs from the bottle and says, “Listen, I don’t give a fuck about that shit. I’m black; I’ve been black all my life. Which means I’ve been putting up with stupid shit all my life. I didn’t kill myself all the times I’ve heard white people say nigger, I didn’t kill myself every time I applied for a job and didn’t get hired, and noticed that there were no black employees in there. I grew up in the Youngstown projects. You think I’m gonna give up now. When I was five momma my used to send me to the store to steal bread and forties for her. All I have known is struggle and suffering. This is just another day to me, perhaps the assholes will be killed. Maybe I’ll have a chance to be just a human for once in my life. And not always have to be the black man. Because you know what, you know who will survive this. Not the rich people, not the white collar pencil pushers. But resilient poor ass mother fuckers like us. You think this is luck, you think this is destiny. No, the reason we have survived is because this culture since the day we were born have beat us into steel, beat us into crazy violent monsters. We are still here, because we also monsters. We are monsters like them. And I’m sure out there in Nebraska, to California, to Maine there are some poor ass whites, blacks and Mexicans hiding in basements together. Because us poor folk are resilient. This society had monsters way before today. Two different types of monsters. Those on top and those on bottom. The ones on top don’t get their hands dirty like we do. But they are still monsters. If those zombies think for one second they have exhausted my rage, my desire to keep living, they are fucking wrong. Listen Esmeralda, this ain’t the end for me. After those fuckers are dead, it’s a new beginning. There’s one thing you’re forgetting, with that Super Volcano, those pandemics, some always escaped, some always made it. We all come from those that escaped. You know how many Africans got killed on the boat ride over, how many got killed by their slave-masters, how many of your family probably died of influenza and tuberculosis. We are the ones that escaped.” Esmeralda takes a swig from the bottle. < + >"

    "text": "POEM < TOUCH MY OMELET by MICHAEL EARL CRAIG > POEM I like to exist in seersucker. Only the best all-cotton seersucker. Shorts and shirt. Details details details. And when I’m in combed cotton chinos I want them relaxed-fit. And wrinkle free. And I want my polos from Peru. I want them so soft and silky I feel special just slipping one on. That’s what I call it, slipping one on. Like when a wash of mountain air slides in. Like when an unusually huge crane flies over and you feel that patriotic rush, those other engines, rubber fingers, like withheld velvet. It’s a coming home to Mama, a whisper into the delicate ear of blowzy dawn, into the side of dawn’s head (there’s a hole) which tilts slightly, listening. Characteristically is how children lick bookshelves. Stoically is how the bookshelves take it. Philosophically is how a corpse might settle. And terrifically--terrifically is how a day old rabbit hops, how a whore snorts, how a whip cracks, how a castle flashes. Are you familiar with how a castle flashes?"

Student said “Hello Master Chang!” To which Master Chang nodded once. Master Chang stood at a table holding a jade-handled knife of medium size. “Damascus,” said Master Chang, tilting the blade in the light. “Damascus,” said Student. Master Chang had a square tray and a lime. He drew the knife’s edge quickly back, toward himself, with subtle rigor, across the top of the lime. The knife cleanly halved the lime. “See how absolutely divisive the knife is.” “Yes, Master,” said Student. The two walked in the garden. Master Chang stopped and bent down. A toad was sunbathing on a small rock. Master Chang poked the toad in the rear with his cane. The toad hopped forward, twice. “See how this toad moves along.” “Yes, Master,” said Student. A train full of soldiers could be heard creaking slowly into Student’s mental trainyard. At least this is what the Master sensed. The soldiers sweated in their train cars, playing cards and waiting in their dark uniforms. Some oiled their weapons. A few wrote letters home. One sat calmly, arm-wrestling the others, one after another, a neat stack of bills in his helmet on the seat beside him. The Master stopped and looked at Student. “What? Master Chang,” said Student. “I am wondering about you,” said the Master. Student said nothing. Then: “We have touched upon your sublime knife and seen how absolutely divisive it is; we have come across the lazy toad and seen how he moves along; now if I may--” Master Chang interrupted Student: “Have I told you what type of baby I was?” “No, Master,” replied Student. “I rode quietly in Mother’s backpack looking out,” said the Master. “I was a deadpan baby. An unflappable baby. A pokerfaced baby.” Student nodded his head."

Thoughts of famous Dutch hermits who might’ve been frauds; various memories in cardboard; someone’s greasy thumbprints on my Whopper; the vet’s cologne a week later on the dog’s collar. I close my eyes again… she comes into my office. She has a beautiful wooden ear. I have heard about it. Brush the hair from my eyes, I have let a bowlcut get out of hand. Idea for Sigourney Weaver tombstone: “You saw my panties in Alien.” Back on the couch, my face in the cushions, where I see myself handling money, cautiously— opening each bill and smoothing it flat in the palm of my hand. The bills smell like sharkskin, shake like monster celebrity boobs. You can’t leave it to me to describe your world."

Jan. 7, 1998 I remember reading the obituaries when Sonny Bono died and laughing so hard I fell down on the floor. And I remember trying to get up--my face ached, my stomach was cramping--so I could continue reading this to my brother over the telephone. But I was choking, literally, and was so totally out of control that it no longer had anything to do with Sonny Bono. I could not stop this insane laughter, so I stood up sharply and threw a series of jabs into the air. Real uppercuts. I was only partially robed. It was early. I was having coffee and oranges, I guess it was Sunday. And now I’m writing this on a bagel-bag, glancing down, swerving, looking up, glancing down again, as I drive my newly lacquered motorcoach up an icy mountain pass at dusk on my way to see my therapist who once spent 3 years in the circus with her “Largest Tits in North America.” She always cries during our sessions. And then, every time, she wipes her eyes and carefully states that someday I will get it all together, and not drift so blindly like the seahorse with his throat slit, leaking a dark scarf across his moonlit coral homeland."

Not because he cared. But because it is currently in style for a Baptist to want such things. Preacher Elmer had lived a stupid life. He lived with a fat woman who never had sex with him. Had two kids he constantly beat. Drove an SUV. He always told people, “I love my SUV. Mount Kilimanjaro doesn’t have any snow, I’m sure the liberal devil took it away. “ He would spend his nights masturbating to women being fucked by horses. He never mentioned that. He also considered all black, Hispanic, homosexuals and poor people disgusting atrocious monsters that were created by the devil to serve satanic crap he made up in his head as he spoke. And he spoke a lot. Because he loved to hear it. One day he spoke for over two hours on how unions were killing God and allowing the devil to sneak up people’s bowels. At the end of the sermon he concluded that unions are causing an inevitably nuclear war which would kill the daily beaten Christian children. Preacher Elmer has returned from the dead. He is unsure what happened to him. But he convinced that God has done it. That God, has brought Preacher Elmer back from the dead because he the greatest preacher on the earth.

We are here to discuss the state of resurrected life and our great and our soon to be triumphant battle against the human species. We are at a time of great consequence. We must discuss every danger that threatens the resurrected nation and what act must be taken to ensure that the human element in this society is wiped away completely from the earth. Our war against humans is a contest of will in which perseverance is power. This nation has made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the humans to live-- free resurrected will set the course of history. The resurrected are a resolute undead who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of the resurrected, to the world and to ourselves. Resurrected America is a strong nation, and honorable in the use of our strength. We exercise power and kill all the mother fuckers who oppose us. “ None of the dead that attended even looked up.

One of the undead, an older man named Rudolf who was a back doctor until he got fired for fucking his patients rapes her until his maggot invested penis falls off inside of her cunt. < + >"

    "text": "THE LIVING AND THE DEAD | seventeen THE LIVING AND THE DEADby Noah Cicero < + > seventeen In the bar area of the strip club. It is a normal strip club. Not one of those fancy ones that are always shown in movies. Or one of those creepy ones sometimes showed in movie either. It has a good sized stage with seats surrounding it. The clientele are normal men. Most are average working class men. Dave walks into the bar. He sits down at the bar. The bartender comes over. She is an attractive woman. She has short blonde and a kind smile. “Hey baby, how are you?” Says Dave. “Good,” says the bartender. “How come you work here? If you want.you can come home with me right now and I’ll take care of you.” “Oh yeah.” “Yeah. I’m an ex-marine. You know ex-marines can take of a woman good. You know that right?” \"I went out with an ex-marine once. He was good looking as hell. But all he wanted to do was check my cell calls and look at my emails. No fucking thank you.” “I ain’t like that. I’m a good man. I’ll take care of you. I’ll be your man. All you gotta do if you’re with me is sit on the couch all day, watch soaps, and cook dinner.” “I don’t watch soaps and I don’t know how to cook.. I’ve been working since I was 14. You think I’m just gonna sit down and sit on a couch and wait for your ass to come home every night?” “Yeah baby. You don’t need to work. It ain’t a woman’s place to work in society. Haven’t you heard, real men are coming back. Women can go back to raising kids and cooking and cleaning. My mom told me that all women are biologically prone to becoming housewives. And I believe my mom.” “I’m in college for hospitality management. I’m gonna own myself a strip joint one day and probably work 12 hours a day to keep it going. I don’t have time for kids or cooking.” “No. That is not true. All women want kids. You want kids. And you want to be a housewife.” “Prove it.” “Prove what?” “That all women want to be housewives and have kids.” “It’s true. I read it in TIME magazine.” “Time magazine made Hitler, Stalin, Charles De Gaulle, Nixon, Reagan, Bush, and fucking Bono Person of The Year.. A bunch of idiots and murderers. Like anything that comes out of that magazine can be believed.” “Hmm. Baby you don’t know what you’re missing.” Frankie walks into the bar. The bartender tells Dave, “I gotta take care of this customer.” The bartender walks over to him. He is sitting down at the bar looking miserable. “How are you today?” Says the bartender. “Bored and horny,” says Frankie. “You’re telling me.” “Got any good news?” “There’s a bunch of shit going on in Youngstown. There are cops everywhere. I don’t know what’s going on though.” “Probably another gang war.”. “Fucking Youngstown. I’m moving to Hubbard. I gotta get out that bitch.” “I live in Hubbard. A couple of good cheap Italian places to eat.” “Yeah. I saw them when looking for an apartment.” They talk for a while more. About nothing really. Nothing heroic or tragic. Just conversation. Just two people talking about shit that goes on, on planet earth. < + >"

    "text": "THE LIVING AND THE DEAD | eighteen THE LIVING AND THE DEADby Noah Cicero < + > eighteen Layla is twelve-years-old walking around the local convenient store. She looks around. Doesn’t see anybody looking. She grabs a pack of gum and sticks it in her pocket. She walks slowly out the store. A little away from the store she throws a piece of gum in her mouth. Layla walks into the trailer where she lives and sits down on the couch. Her father is sitting on a reclining chair in the living room. Layla’s father looks at her and says, “What the fuck are you chewing?” Layla, “Gum.” “Where’d you get that gum?” “I don’t know.” “I don’t know, how do you not fucking know?” “Hmm, I don’t know.” “You stole it, didn’t you?” “No.” “Come here Layla.” Layla stands up and walks over to her daddy. Her daddy stares at her. Then he punches her right in the stomach. Layla collapses to the floor and cries. “Don’t fucking steal again!” Layla is 18-years-old. She is drunk at a party. She is barely able to speak laying on a couch. Drool is coming out of the side of her mouth. A boy her age, named Jeff come over to her and says, “Hey, you wanna come upstairs with me?” Layla looks at him drunkenly and says, “Yeah, that sounds good.” Jeff leads her upstairs. They go into a bedroom. Layla falls onto the bed. Jeff takes her shirt off. Layla is so drunk she doesn’t even notice. Jeff puts his face close to Layla’s. There is sweat on their faces. Jeff says in a tense whisper, “Now listen bitch, I am going to smash your cunt with cock. Then I’m going to jam deep into your ass. And during the whole thing I want you to call me Pumpkin. You fucking got that.” With her eyes barely open Layla says, “All right Pumpkin.” Jeff takes the rest of her clothes off and then throws them out the window. Jeff flips her over. He inserts. He pumps for a while, then switches to her ass. During this Layla is yelling, “Oh, Pumpkin, you dirty Pumpkin.” Jeff tells her, “Shut up bitch!” “Don’t tell me to shut up you piss ant!” “What did you say bitch!” Jeff punches her in the back of the head. Layla did not like that. She looks around and sees a plastic alarm clock. She grabs it. Jeff doesn’t notice because his eyes are closed. She holds it tight then spins around and clocks him with it in the face. Jeff in his drunken state falls to the floor of the bed. Layla gets off the bed and wraps the cord of the alarm clock around Jeff’s neck and begins choking him and screaming for help. A couple guys came in. One of the guys says, “What he do?” “He hit me,” says Layla. The two guys beat the mortal shit out of Jeff. Layla sits and watches drinking from a bottle of Bourbon. She laughs hysterically. Then fucks the two guys who beat up Jeff. < + >"

    "text": "TAO LIN - TAIPEI - CYOA Tuesday, November 20, 2018 It began raining a little from a hazy, cloudless-seeming sky as Paul, 26, and Michelle, 21, walked toward Chelsea to attend a magazine-release party in an art gallery. Paul had resigned to not speaking and was beginning to feel more like he was “moving through the universe” than “walking on a sidewalk.” He stared ahead with a mask-like expression, weakly trying to remember where he was one year ago, last November, more for something to do than because he wanted to know, though he was not incurious. Michelle, to his left, drifted in and out of his peripheral vision—far enough away for pedestrians to pass unknowingly between them—like a slow, amorphous flickering. Paul was thinking the word “somewhere,” meditatively as both placeholder and ends, when Michelle asked if he was okay. “Yes,” said Paul automatically. As they entered a building, a few minutes later, he sort of glanced at Michelle and was surprised to see her grinning, then couldn’t stop himself from grinning. Sometimes, during an argument, feeling like he’d been acting in a movie and the scene had ended, Paul would suddenly grin, causing Michelle to grin, and they’d be able to enjoy doing things together again, for one to forty hours, but that hadn’t happened this time, partly because Michelle had grinned first. Paul looked away, slightly confused, and suppressed his grin. “What,” he said in an unintentionally loud monotone, unsure what he felt exactly, and they entered a large, mundane elevator, whose door closed slowly. “What,” said Paul at a normal volume. “Nothing,” said Michelle still grinning a little. “Why are you grinning?” “No reason,” said Michelle. “What caused you to grin?” “Nothing. Just life. The situation.” [ENTER PARTY] [STAND THERE] Posted by Nate at 2:49 AM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Home"

    "title": "111: ENTER PARTY",
    "text": "111: ENTER PARTY Tuesday, November 20, 2018 ENTER PARTY Entering the party, on the fifth floor, Paul realized he’d said vaguely negative things on the internet, at some point, about a person who was probably in attendance, so walked quickly to Jeremy—an easy-to-talk-to acquaintance—and asked what movies he’d seen recently. Michelle stood at a near distance—partly in view, then obscured, then fully in view—before approaching, with what seemed like a sly smile, to ask if Paul wanted a drink. Jeremy was calculating aloud the per-hour price of a two-part biopic on Che Guevara when Michelle returned with a beer. Paul thanked her and she moved away in an intermittent, curving, crab-like manner, seeming relaxed and disoriented. “She wants to be alone,” thought Paul with some confusion. “Or she wants to let me be alone.”An hour later they were holding their third or fourth drinks, sitting on chairs in a dark corner, facing what seemed to Paul like one group of sixty to eighty friends. Loud, dancey, mostly electronic music—currently Michael Jackson—played from unseen speakers. Paul was staring at an area of torsos. In his previous relationships, he knew, he had experienced dissatisfaction, to some degree, as an empirically backed enthusiasm for the future, because it implied the possibility of a more satisfying relationship with someone he hadn’t met; with Michelle, whom he felt closer to than his previous girlfriends—he’d told her this a few times, truthfully—dissatisfaction felt more like a personal failing, a direct indication of internal malfunctioning, which he should focus on privately correcting. Instead, he vaguely knew, he was waiting for Michelle, or some combination of Michelle and the world, to endure and overpower his negativity—to be the solution in which he would irreversibly, untraceably dissolve. He sipped his wine, thinking about how Michael Jackson had been using ten to forty Xanax per night, according to the internet, before he died last summer. Paul distractedly scooted his chair toward Michelle and, with unclear purpose, touched her shoulder, tentative and reckless as a child petting a large dog looking elsewhere. Expecting the bored expression of ten minutes ago, when they’d looked at each other noncommittally as she returned to her chair with another drink, Paul was surprised by Michelle’s severely, actively—almost seethingly—depressed expression. Michelle’s face reddened antagonistically, in reflexive defense, it seemed, because then she appeared frustrated and a little confused, then shy and embarrassed. Paul asked if she wanted to leave soon. Michelle hesitated, then asked if that was what Paul wanted.“I don’t know. Are you hungry?”“Not really. Are you?”“I don’t know,” said Paul. “I would eat somewhere.” One night, months ago, they had sat on a curb on Lafayette Street to continue an argument in a resting position. Paul had become distracted by Michelle’s calm, intelligent demeanor and had begun to forget why they were arguing, even while speaking in an agitated voice, as he became fixated, with increasing appreciation, on how Michelle liked him enough to not simply leave and never see him again, which she could do—which anyone could always do, Paul had thought, suddenly intrigued by the concept of gratitude. “Do you want to eat at the Green Table?”“If that’s what you want,” said Michelle.“Okay. When do you want to leave?”“After I finish this glass of wine.” [GO FIND KYLE] Posted by Nate at 4:14 AM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Home"

    "text": "111: GO FIND KYLE Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO FIND KYLE “Okay,” said Paul, and scooted his chair halfway to where it had been. “I’m going to introduce Kyle to someone. I’ll be back in like five minutes.”Paul couldn’t find Kyle, 19, or Kyle’s girlfriend, Gabby, 28—his suitemates in an apartment off the Graham L train stop in Brooklyn—and was returning to Michelle when he realized he’d walked past Kyle, standing drunkenly alone in a dense area of people, as if at a concert. After some indecision, briefly motionless, Paul turned around and asked if Kyle wanted to meet Traci. Kyle nodded and followed Paul outside the gallery, to a wide hallway, where six people, including Traci—described earlier by Kyle as “really hot,” by Paul as “her blog gets a lot of hits”—shook hands with one another. Paul grinned uncomfortably as he stared at one person, then  another, thinking he had “absolutely nothing” to say, except maybe what he was currently thinking, which didn’t seem appropriate and also kept changing. He noticed Michelle sitting alone, against a wall, around thirty feet away. The front of his head felt extraneous and suctioned as a plastic bag, stuck there in a wind, as he walked to her, aware she had probably seen him grinning at Traci, and asked if she wanted to go now.“Do you?” said Michelle not standing.“Yeah,” said Paul looking toward the gallery.“You can talk to Kyle more, if you want.”“I don’t want to,” said Paul.“It seems like you do.”“I don’t,” said Paul, who viewed friends mostly as means to girlfriends, he knew, contrary to Michelle, who valued them as ends (they’d discussed this a few times and concluded, to some degree, that Paul had his writing, Michelle her friends). “I’m just going to say bye to him. I’ll be right back.” When he couldn’t find Kyle in the hallway he walked robotically into the dark, crowded gallery thinking “lost in the world” in a precariously near-earnest tone. Kyle was standing with a group of people in a sideways manner that didn’t clearly indicate if he knew them or not. He looked at Paul with an expression like he was thinking what to say, then like he was going to insult Paul, then less like he’d chosen to refrain than like he’d lost interest.“I think Michelle feels like I’m not giving her enough attention,” said Paul slowly.“That’s funny,” said Kyle after a few seconds. “Because Gabby, after one of our parties, said you gave Michelle so much attention and were always next to her talking to her, but I’m always talking to someone else, and that I don’t love her.”“What did you say?”“That I love her and give her attention,” said Kyle with a bored, self-loathing expression.

    "title": "111: FIND MICHELLE AND LEAVE",
    "text": "111: FIND MICHELLE AND LEAVE Tuesday, November 20, 2018 FIND MICHELLE AND LEAVE Paul couldn’t find Michelle in the hallway, then turned a corner and saw her crouched on the floor, sixty to eighty feet away, discrepant and vulnerable, in the bright off-white corridor, as a rarely seen animal. Paul, walking self-consciously toward her, vaguely remembered a night, early in their relationship, when he somehow hadn’t expected her to enlarge in his vision as he approached where she’d stood (looking down at a flyer, one leg slightly bent) in Think Coffee. The comical, bewildering fear—equally calming and surprising, amusing and foreboding—he’d felt as she rapidly and sort of ominously increased in size had characterized their first two months together. It had seemed like they would never fight, and the nothingness of the future had gained a framework-y somethingness that felt privately exciting, like entering a different family’s house as a small child, or the beginning elaborations of a science-fiction conceit. Then, one night, in late April, after cooking and eating pasta together, Paul had complained—meekly, without looking at her face—that Michelle never helped wash dishes. Michelle stared at him silently a few seconds before her eyes became suddenly watery, the extra layer of translucence materializing like a shedding of something delicate. Paul stared back, weirdly entranced—he’d never seen her cry—before crawling across his wood floor, over his yoga mat, dizzy with emotion, to hug her and apologize. In May he began complaining once or twice a week (that certain things Michelle did were inconsiderate, that he felt neglected) and, by July, most days, was either visibly irritated or mutely, inscrutably despondent—as if he alone had a vast knowledge of horrible truths, which, he knew, he didn’t—but could still feel good, to some degree, after coffee or alcohol or, when easily attainable, prescription drugs, most recently methadone, supplied by Michelle’s friend who had fallen down stairs, which they’d ingested once every four to six days for five weeks, ending three weeks ago. One night, since then, Michelle had told Paul it seemed like he “hated” her and Paul, after around ten seconds, had cited a day they’d had fun together, then had grinned and said “no” illogically when Michelle correctly said they’d been on methadone that day.“Why are you sitting so far away?”“I’m waiting for you. You said you wanted to leave an hour ago.”Outside, on the sidewalk, Michelle walked quickly ahead with her hands in her jacket pockets, as if to better escape Paul with a more streamlined form, though also it was still raining. Paul asked what she wanted to do. “I don’t know,” she said. “I’m not hungry anymore.”They crossed 10th Avenue in a diagonal, not at an intersection, through headlights of a stopped taxi—two or three people were closing their umbrellas, getting in—onto the opposite sidewalk and continued downtown, bodies bent against the wind.“Wait,” said Paul. “Can we stop walking for a minute?”They stopped, facing the same direction, on the sidewalk.“What’s wrong?” said Paul after a few seconds, slightly accusatorily.“You’ve been ignoring me all night,” said Michelle.“I moved close to you and hugged you, when we were sitting.”“Once we got inside you walked away and started talking to other people.”“You walked away from me,” said Paul. “I felt confused.”A deli worker standing under an awning was looking into some unspecific distance, honestly uninterested. “I’ve never felt you act this way before,” said Michelle unsteadily, looking down, suddenly tired and scared, the protest of her having dispersed to something negotiable. For a few days, two or three months ago, she had considered studying abroad in Barcelona next spring, which would’ve meant four months apart. Paul thought of how they’d kept delaying buying plane tickets to visit his parents in Taiwan—in December, which was next month, he knew—as if in tacit understanding that their relationship wouldn’t last that long. Paul felt himself trying to interpret the situation, as if there was a problem to be solved, but there didn’t seem to be anything, or maybe there was, but he was three or four skill sets away from comprehension, like an amoeba trying to create a personal web-page using CSS.“I’m just naturally losing interest,” he finally said, a little improvisationally, and Michelle began quietly crying. “I didn’t expect this at all,” she said. “I’ve felt good about us the past two weeks. I thought we’ve been closer than we’ve ever been.”“I think I was affected by the study-abroad thing,” said Paul nearly inaudibly, confused how she’d thought they’d been close the past two weeks.“Go back to the party. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”“Wait. I don’t think we should leave each other now.”“Have a good time with your friends,” said Michelle sincerely.“Wait. What friends?”“We’ll talk tomorrow,” said Michelle.“If we leave each other now it’s over.”“It doesn’t have to be like that.”“I only go to things to find a girlfriend,” said Paul paraphrasing himself, and they stood not looking at each other, for one or two minutes, as rain from faraway places disappeared into their clothing and hair. Paul felt surprised by the friendly tone of his voice as he asked if Michelle wanted to eat dinner with him, in a restaurant.“I don’t want to talk to you right now,” said Michelle.“I don’t want to be in a relationship where it’s like this.”“I don’t either,” said Michelle.“I’m going back if you don’t want to do something.”“I want to go home. Good night.”“Okay,” said Paul, and turned around, aware they hadn’t parted like this before. He crossed 22nd Street and turned to cross 10th Avenue and saw Michelle disjunctively running and walking toward him, stopping at a red light with the posture of a depressed teenager. Paul thought of how she liked Nirvana a lot, and she crossed the street, slowing as she neared and stopping within arm’s reach. “Paul,” she said after a few seconds, and touched his upper arm, as if to offer a way back, through her, to some prior intimacy, from where they could tunnel carefully elsewhere, or to the same place, but with a kind of skill this time, having practiced once. Paul remained still, unsure what to say or think. Michelle lowered her hand to her side. “What are you doing?” she said, somewhat defensively.“What do you mean?”“Aren’t you going back to the party?”“Yeah. I said I was.”“Fine,” said Michelle.Paul felt passively committed to not moving.“Why are you standing here?”“You came back,” said Paul feebly, and four to six people approached from the direction of the party. Michelle stepped into a soil-y area, lower and darker than the sidewalk, and leaned between spires on a metal fence, with her left profile—obscured by her long, dark hair—toward Paul, who stared dumbly at the gently convex curve of her back, thinking with theoretical detachment that he should console her and that maybe the discomfort of her forearms against the thin metal of the fence had created a location, accessible only to herself, toward which she could relocate, away from what she felt, in a kind of shrinking. “Do you—” said Paul, and coughed twice with his mouth closed. “Do you want to eat dinner with me somewhere?” Michelle turned toward him a little, moving her head to see through her hair. “What are you doing?” she said in a tired, distracted voice, and leaned back on the fence without waiting for an answer. After a vague amount of time Paul heard himself asking again if she wanted to eat dinner with him, at the Green Table, one of the few restaurants they wanted to but hadn’t tried, then she was walking away, her long legs scissor-like in their little, orderly movements. It would take her thousands of steps to get anywhere, but she would get there easily, and when she arrived, in the present, it would seem like it had been a single movement that brought her there. Did existence ever seem worked for? One seemed simply to be here, less an accumulation of moments than a single arrangement continuously gifted from some inaccessible future.As Michelle became smaller, then out of view, Paul distantly sensed the implication, from his previous thoughts, which he’d mostly forgotten, that the universe in its entirety was a message, to itself, to not feel bad—an ever-elaborating, languageless rhetoric against feeling bad—and he was troubled by this, suspecting that his thoughts and intentions, at some point, in April or May or years ago, in college or as a child, had been wrong, but he had continued in that wrongness, and was now distanced from some correct beginning to a degree that the universe (and himself, a part of the universe) was articulately against him.In his tiredness and inattention these intuitions manifested in Paul as an uncomplicated feeling of bleakness—that he was in the center of something bad, whose confines were expanding, as he remained in the same place. Faintly he recognized in this a kind of humor, but mostly he was aware of the rain, continuous and everywhere as an incognizable information, as he crossed the magnified street, gleaming and blacker from wetness, to return to the party.[RETURN TO BED AND SLEEP][RETURN TO TAIPEI] Posted by Nate at 5:19 AM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Older Post Home"

    "title": "rtt-r: GO TO TAIPEI",
    "text": "rtt-r: GO TO TAIPEI Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO TO TAIPEI Michelle’s absence in Taiwan was mentioned once, at dinner with eight to twelve relatives, a week into Paul’s visit, when Paul’s father, 61, characteristically without prompting or context, loudly joked that Paul’s girlfriends always left him, then laughed in an uncontrollable-seeming, close-eyed, almost wincing manner. Paul’s mother, 57, responded with aggravation that the opposite was true and that Paul’s father shouldn’t “lie recklessly,” she said in Mandarin.Paul hadn’t seen his parents since they sold their house in Florida a year and a half ago and moved back to Taiwan, after almost thirty years in America, into a fourteenth-floor apartment, in a rapidly developing area of Taipei, with two guest rooms that his mother had repeatedly stressed were Paul’s room and Paul’s brother’s room. Paul thought his parents looked the same, but he viewed his mother, who had been diagnosed as “prediabetic,” a little differently, maybe as finally past middle age, though not yet elderly. Her emails, the past eight months, had frequently mentioned, as sort of asides, or reminders, to herself mostly, that she was using less sugar in her daily coffee, but really shouldn’t be using any—her most emphasized message to her family, the past two decades, in Paul’s view, was the importance of health to a happy life—though her doctor had said the amount she used was okay, and on days without sugar in her coffee, which was  decaf, she felt “empty, like something is missing,” she had said in one email.When, one afternoon, Paul saw her putting sugar in her coffee, it seemed to them both like she’d been “caught” doing something wrong. She blushed and briefly focused self-consciously on stirring her coffee with a little spoon, then she looked at Paul and her mouth reflexively opened in an endearingly child-like, self-concious, almost mischievous display of guilt and shame and repentance that Paul recognized from the rare times he’d seen her do things she’d told him not to do, such as eat food that had fallen on the floor. After a grinning Paul obligatorily said something negative about sugar, that everyone, not only diabetics, should avoid it, his mother’s expression resolved to the controlled, smirking, wryly satisfied demeanor of an adult who is slightly more amused than embarrassed to have been caught idly succumbing to a meager comfort that they’ve openly disapproved of for themselves and others. Paul unintentionally caught his mother using sugar two more times, the next two weeks, resulting in similar—but less intense—reactions and outcomes. The 24oz organic raw agave nectar he had mailed her, believing it was the safest sweetener for diabetics, had been opened but not used, it seemed, more than once or twice.His fourth week in Taiwan, one more week than planned, his mother began encouraging him two or three times a day—with a slightly affected, strategic nonchalance, Paul felt—to move to Taiwan for one year to teach English. She mentioned Ernest Hemingway more than once while saying Paul would benefit, as a writer, from the interesting experience. Paul said he would benefit by being in America, where he could speak the language and maintain friendships and “do things,” he said in Mandarin, visualizing himself on his back, on his yoga mat, with his MacBook on the inclined surface of his thighs, formed by bending his knees, looking at the internet.  His parents encouraged him to stay a fifth week, which with some difficulty he decided against, thinking it “excessive,” after which—his last few days in Taiwan—his mother began to stress that he should visit every December from now on, stating it as a fact, then making a noise meaning “right?” Paul’s responses ranged from “maybe,” to neutral-to-annoyed noises, to an explanation of why the more she pressured him the less influence she’d have on his decisions.At the airport Paul’s mother stayed with Paul until she wasn’t allowed farther without a ticket. She pointed at her eyes and said they were watery. Paul was “required,” she said in Mandarin with mock sternness, to visit next December.In the terminal, sitting with eyes closed, Paul imagined moving alone to Taipei at an age like 51, when maybe he’d have cycled through enough friendships and relationships to not want more. Because his Mandarin wasn’t fluent enough for conversations with strangers—and he wasn’t close to his relatives, with whom attempts at communication were brief and non-advancing and often koan-like, ending usually with one person looking away, ostensibly for assistance, then leaving—he’d be preemptively estranged, secretly unfriendable. The unindividualized, shifting mass of everyone else would be a screen, distributed throughout the city, onto which he’d project the movie of his uninterrupted imagination. Because he’d appear to, and be able to pretend he was, but never actually be a part of the mass, maybe he’d gradually begin to feel a kind of needless intimacy, not unlike being in the same room as a significant other and feeling affection without touching or speaking. An earnest assembling of the backup life he’d sketched and constructed the blueprints and substructures for (during the average of six weeks per year, spread throughout his life, that he’d been in Taiwan) would begin, at some point, after which, months or years later, one morning, he would sense the independent organization of a second, itinerant consciousness—lured here by the new, unoccupied structures—toward which he’d begin sending the data of his sensory perception. The antlered, splashing, water-treading land animal of his first consciousness would sink to some lower region, in the lake of himself, where he would sometimes descend in sleep and experience its disintegrating particles—and furred pieces, brushing past—in dreams, as it disappeared into the pattern of the nearest functioning system.On the plane, after a cup of black coffee, Paul thought of Taipei as a fifth season, or “otherworld,” outside, or in equal contrast with, his increasingly familiar and self-consciously repetitive life in America, where it seemed like the seasons, connecting in right angles, for some misguided reason, had formed a square, sarcastically framing nothing—or been melded, Paul vaguely imagined, about an hour later, facedown on his arms on his dining tray, into a door-knocker, which a child, after twenty to thirty knocks, no longer expecting an answer, has continued using, in a kind of daze, distracted by the pointlessness of his activity, looking absently elsewhere, unaware when he will abruptly, idly stop.

    "title": "rtt-r: REST",
    "text": "rtt-r: REST Tuesday, November 20, 2018 REST The next two weeks Paul gradually began to view the five months until September, when his second novel would be published and he would go on a two-month book tour, as an “interim period,” during which he would mostly be alone, “calmly organizing things,” he said in an email to his mother. He had already been mostly alone, he knew, since returning from Taiwan, but in a vague way, often wondering if he should’ve gone to whatever social gathering. Now if he felt urges to socialize, to meet a romantic prospect, he would simply relocate them, without further consideration, beyond the “interim period,” when he would be extremely social, he envisioned. Until then he would calmly focus on being productive in a low-level manner, finding to-do lists and unfinished projects in his Gmail account and further organizing, working on, or deleting them, for example.In early April he got an email from Traci asking if she could email-interview him for a website. After a few emails Paul asked Traci, whom he now reasonably, he felt, viewed as a romantic prospect, if she wanted to meet for dinner. At an Asian fusion restaurant, which Traci had suggested, they talked for around fifteen minutes, during which Paul’s interest  steadily increased, before Traci mentioned living with her boyfriend. Paul was aware of the ice hockey game on the flat-screen TV attached to a wall, of the disparity between Thai food and ice hockey, as he slowly said “is, um, is it a studio apartment?”Walking alone, to his room, an hour later, he realized he was deriving comfort from the existence, in his life, of a “backup prospect.” There was a specific girl he liked who liked him back, but he couldn’t remember who, it seemed. When he realized he’d been thinking of Kyle, that he’d unconsciously de-gendered and abstracted Kyle into a kind of silhouette, which he’d successfully presented to himself as a romantic prospect, he grinned uncontrollably for around thirty seconds, almost getting hit by a minivan when, rerouting to a darker street to better hide his face, he jogged somewhat recklessly across an intersection.

    "title": "rtt-r: BE PROFESSIONAL",
    "text": "rtt-r: BE PROFESSIONAL Tuesday, November 20, 2018 BE PROFESSIONAL Paul felt more committed, after that, to viewing the time until September as an interim period, and didn’t have an in-person conversation for more than a week, during which, to his own approval, he seemed to be settling, if precariously, with two days spent mostly eating, into a somewhat productive, loneliness-free routine. He remembered while peeling a banana one night that he had committed, months ago, to a reading in April—in three days, he learned from the internet, in a building near Times Square.At the reading, after arriving ten minutes early by accident and talking to the organizer, then sitting alone and, to appear occupied, holding a pen and staring down at what he’d printed in the library —an account of his trip to Taiwan— where he planned to return immediately after he and Frederick, an author in his early 40s, finished reading, Paul began to feel sleepy, in his seat. Yawning, he looked  up and recognized Mitch, 26, a classmate from middle/ high school in Florida, where they had mutual friends but had never spoken to each other, that Paul could remember, approaching from a conspiratorially far distance, like an FBI agent but slower. Mitch had messaged on Facebook, a few weeks ago, that he might attend this reading.“You look the same. What about me?”“Taller,” said Mitch seeming a little nervous.“How can you tell? I’m sitting.”“The shape of your legs, and your body, I think. Something about your bone structure.”After the reading Lucie, 23, introduced herself and Amy, 23, and Daniel, 25, to Paul and Mitch, saying something about her and Amy’s online magazine. Paul asked if they had business cards, not thinking they would. Amy, after encouragement from Lucie, reluctantly gave Paul a business card, seeming a little embarrassed. When Paul looked up from the business card, putting it in his back pocket, he was startled by the sudden appearance of Frederick smiling at him with his arm around Lucie in a manner that seemed calculated, but wasn’t, Paul knew, to firmly establish they were “together.” A bewildered-seeming, middle-aged woman with an Italian accent asked Paul something about agave nectar, wanting it for a diabetic friend, it seemed. Paul said he’d actually learned, a few months ago, that it raised blood sugar as intensely as sugar and that he’d mailed his mother unheated, unfiltered honey, which was the healthiest sweetener—for diabetics, or anyone—based on what he currently knew, which could be wrong, he also knew.In a taxi to a party, forty minutes later, Paul imagined another him walking toward the library and, for a few seconds, visualizing the position and movement of two red dots through a silhouetted, aerial view of Manhattan, felt as imaginary, as mysterious and transitory and unfindable, as the other dot. He visualized the vibrating, squiggling, looping, arcing line representing the three-dimensional movement, plotted in a cubic grid, of the dot of himself, accounting for the different speed and direction of each vessel of which he was a passenger—taxi, Earth, solar system, Milky Way, etc. Adding a fourth dimension, representing time, he visualized the patterned scribbling shooting off in one direction, with a slight wobble, miles from where it was seconds ago. He imagined his trajectory as a vacuum-sealed tube, into which he’d arrived and through which—traveling alone in the vacuum-sealed tube of his own life—he’d be suctioned and from which he’d exit, as a successful delivery to some unimaginable recipient. Realizing this was only his concrete history, his public movement through space-time from birth to death, he briefly imagined being able to click on his trajectory to access his private experience, enlarging the dot of a coordinate until it could be explored like a planet.[RETURN TO LIBRARY][GO PARTY] Posted by Nate at 5:12 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "rtt-r: GO PARTY",
    "text": "rtt-r: GO PARTY Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO PARTY At the party, which was mostly people in their 30s and 40s, Paul asked Amy an open-ended question about her parents. When she began, after a pause, to answer, he moved his phone from his pants pocket to his ear. “Hello,” he said in a clear voice, and felt physically isolated, like he was wearing a motorcycle helmet, as he peripherally observed Amy moving her wine, almost spilling it, to her mouth.“Just kidding,” said Paul. “No one called me.”Amy had a glassy, disoriented expression.“I don’t have a phone call,” said Paul.“That was good,” said Amy looking away.“Just kidding,” said Paul grinning weakly.The rest of the party, after briefly talking to Lucie, who invited him and Mitch to a party next week at her apartment, Paul talked mostly to Daniel, who had enough money from  selling marijuana in San Francisco that he hadn’t had a job since moving here last autumn. Paul asked if Daniel liked drugs. Daniel said he liked “benzos” and opiates. Paul asked if he liked Rilo Kiley and he became quiet a few seconds, seeming worried, like he might not be able to answer, before saying “um, not really.”Paul went with Daniel, the next night, to a BBQ-themed party, where their main focus, soon after arriving, was on discerning how to leave tactfully, considering how much food they’d eaten and how little they were contributing to conversation, for a party at Kyle and Gabby’s apartment. Standing in a kitchen, at one point, while Daniel was outside smoking, Paul felt like a shark whose eyes have protectively “glossed over” during a feeding frenzy, as he mechanically ate salad, cheese, a burger, apple pie, chips while vaguely focused on not doing anything to cause others to talk to him.At Kyle and Gabby’s apartment—his first time back since moving out—Paul uncharacteristically approached an intriguing, attractive stranger named Laura and asked her questions with a serious expression, standing at a maybe too-close distance, as if after an unskillful teleportation he didn’t want to underscore by fixing. Laura was here with her friend Walter, who knew Gabby. Paul could see that Laura, who wasn’t looking at him, didn’t like his presence and was getting annoyed, but due to alcohol he felt unaffected by this information and kept asking questions, including her age and what college, if any, she attended, or had attended. As Laura’s annoyance intensified to a slightly curious disbelief she became extra alert—focusing exclusively on Paul with a challenging, vigilante expression. She asked why he was asking so many questions.“I’m not. I’m just trying to talk.”“Why are you interrogating me?”“I’m just trying to have a conversation.”“What college did you go to?” said Laura accusatorily.“New York University. How old are you?”Laura walked away, somewhat aimlessly, into the room Paul crawled across the first time he saw Michelle cry—around a year ago, he realized. In the room now was a king-size bed, which occupied maybe 80 percent of its surface. Paul was sitting alone, at the snack table, thirty minutes later, when Laura approached with a bored expression, unaware of his presence until he stood and said “I highly recommend the Funyuns” in an exaggeratedly helpful voice, choosing Funyuns—corn in the shape and flavor of fried rings of onion—somewhat randomly from the eight to twelve snacks on the table.“Oh, really?” said Laura reciprocating his tone.“Let me help you,” said Paul lifting the giant plastic red bowl toward Laura, who chose and bit a piece, then moved backward a little, with a playful expression, nodding and smiling, before turning around and walking away, reappearing around twenty minutes later at a near distance, moving directly, as if after a search, toward an inattentive Paul, seated in the same chair as earlier, not apparently doing anything. Before he could say anything about Funyuns, or form any thoughts, Laura had told him her full name, which she wanted him to memorize, quizzing him on it twice—crudely, functionally—before abruptly walking away.Around midnight an aimlessly wandering Gabby, appearing lost in her own kitchen, stopped in front of Daniel and said “you have a nose ring,” with a slightly confused expression to Daniel, who confirmed he did. Gabby, a foot and a half shorter than Daniel, stared up at him a few seconds before saying something that, Paul thought, conveyed she earnestly believed nose rings were objectively bad. She asked where Daniel was from and said “oh, that makes sense, then,” appearing visibly less tense, when Daniel said San Francisco.Paul, staring at Daniel’s left profile, said “I just realized you look like Hugh Jackman.”“He looks like Richard Tuttle,” said Gabby.“I don’t know who that is,” said Daniel.Gabby said Richard Tuttle was a famous artist. Daniel said when he was young his father only brought him to galleries and museums whenever they went anywhere. Paul heard someone say “sculptor.” Someone who didn’t know Daniel drunkenly said “he got the nose ring so people won’t think he’s Hugh Jackman” to Paul at close range. Gabby mentioned another artist Daniel didn’t know and Paul began to sometimes say “you’re too mainstream for us” in a loud, sarcastic voice while staring at Gabby—thinking that, by underscoring that he and Daniel were obviously too mainstream for her, he was sincerely complimenting her knowledge of the art world—who ignored him easily, with no indication of any awareness of his presence. When Gabby finally looked at him, seeming more confused than agitated, Paul sarcastically sustained a huge grin, which Gabby stared at blankly while appearing to be thinking, very slowly, due to alcohol, about what, if anything, she should do about what was happening. After around five seconds she walked away with a slight, momentary wobble. Kyle appeared around fifteen minutes later and said “leave” to Daniel, who was grinning about something else.“Huh?” said Daniel.“Leave,” said Kyle.“Are you serious?”“Yes,” said Kyle, and Paul realized, with a sensation of low-level epiphany, that Gabby, offended by the nose-ring encounter, must have forced Kyle to tell Daniel to leave. Paul said this aloud a few times, to seemingly no one, then asked why Kyle was “being mean.” Daniel said he would leave after he finished his drink and Kyle said “that’s fine” and walked away.“Jesus,” said Paul. “Gabby hates nose rings.”“I didn’t think she was angry when we talked,” said Daniel.“You’re probably benefiting this party the most out of anyone,” said Paul. “You’re standing in one place, occasionally saying something witty, causing people passing by to laugh. You’re not even eating anything.”“I planned to go to another party anyway,” said Daniel.Almost half the party, thirty minutes later, was on the wide sidewalk outside the apartment building, grinning drunk-enly or looking at one another with openly bored or neutral expressions, waiting for directions to the other party. Paul, who was grinning uncontrollably, had approached groups of acquaintances asking if they wanted to go to a different party while a cheerful-seeming Daniel, standing in place in the kitchen, sometimes assumed the role of an unruly tyrant, saying things like “get every single person” and “we aren’t leaving until you get every person.” Paul had wanted to tell Daniel he shouldn’t want so much from life but couldn’t remember the stock phrase for “don’t want too much in life” and, after a long pause, had said “you shouldn’t want so much in life.” Mitch had repeatedly held shots of tequila toward Paul, who drank two and, at one point, entered the small room where  Kyle and Gabby slept and interrupted Gabby and Jeremy and Juan by asking if “anyone” wanted to go to “a different party,” aware he was unaffected, due to alcohol, by Gabby’s presence.Someone said it probably wasn’t a good idea to stand “in a giant mass blocking the entire sidewalk” in front of the party they’d just abandoned, and the group of twelve to fifteen people began walking in a direction, led vaguely by Daniel, who was talking into his phone. Laura slung an arm around Paul’s shoulder and said “Paul” loudly and that she was going to slap him if the party wasn’t good and asked for a cigarette. Paul said he didn’t smoke and Laura walked away. After around ten blocks Daniel moved his phone away from his head and told Paul—and three or four other people within range—that they’d walked in the wrong direction. Paul said someone needed to make an announcement because the group, which wasn’t stopping, was too large for information to spread naturally to itself. “We walked the wrong way,” shouted Mitch. “Stop walking. We walked the wrong way.”People scattered a little, on the sidewalk, looking at their phones, seeming confused but surprisingly calm, except Laura’s friend Walter, who was moving an unopened Red Bull Soda in arcs through the air, as if wielding it, while sometimes saying “what’s the address of the party?” to seemingly no one, with an agitated expression, then abruptly walked away, followed by Laura.“Wait,” said Paul, and hit her shoulder with a chopping motion while intending to touch it lightly. Laura briefly turned only her head—she was frowning—while continuing to walk away. Paul went with Daniel and Mitch to the other party, which they found after around forty minutes, when everyone else had gone home, to bars, or sheepishly back to Kyle and Gabby’s party.

    "title": "dd: RETURN TO LIBRARY",
    "text": "dd: RETURN TO LIBRARY Tuesday, November 20, 2018 RETURN TO LIBRARY Paul got out of the taxi near Union Square and was walking towards NYU when he discovered Gabby had defriended him on Facebook and was surprised that Kyle, his closest friend the past two years, except the nine months he was with Michelle, had also defriended him and that both had unfollowed him on Twitter. On a dark street with no people, moving cars, or stores, Paul’s head felt more elevated than normal—and his neck, spindly and gopher-like, more biological and uncontrolled—as he looked in different directions. Paul looked at his phone—staring at its screen for ten to twenty seconds without thinking—and noticed he had a Facebook friend request. Around 90 seconds after accepting Daniel on Facebook, Paul recieved a message from him asking if he was \"still nearby Manhattan.\"  In Washington Square Park Daniel arrived with his friend Fran, 22, whose intriguing gaze, Paul noticed with interest, seemed both disbelieving and transfixed in discernment, as if meticulously studying what she knew she was hallucinating. Daniel was holding Paul's leather jacket, which Paul did not remember losing, or even wearing that night, and said Fran had wanted him to steal it. Paul offered Fran to keep it and each took turns trying on the jacket, which seemed to best fit Paul, who discovered two gigantic vitamin-like pills in one of its pockets upon putting it on. Not wanting to possibly reveal his drug use but feeling an \"urgent\" need to alter his consciousness, Paul put the pills into his mouth in a stereotypically indiscriminate manner he’d previously seen only on TV or in movies. After talking slowly and incoherently, he felt, on topics that didn’t interest him, with increasing calmness, and now feeling peacefully catatonic, like a person in a photograph, except for a pressure to speak and a vague awareness that he couldn’t remember what anyone had said, Paul mentioned that the underground computer labs in Bobst Library were a good place to \"work on things.\" Fran said she wanted to live inside Bobst like \"Bobst Boy,\" a NYU student who spent eight months living in the Library's basement, but that she couldn't get in because she wasn't a student. Paul said he wasn’t a student anymore but someone had made a mistake and given him access until 2012. Daniel asked if Paul liked drugs. Paul replied yes and asked if Daniel liked drugs. Daniel said he liked “benzos” and opiates and had enough money from selling marijuana in San Francisco that he hadn’t had a job in since moving here last autumn. Paul asked if he liked Rilo Kiley and Daniel became quiet a few seconds, seeming worried, like he might not be able to answer, before saying “um, not really.” [ASK FOR DRUGS] Posted by Nate at 8:49 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Home"

Paul swallowed two of what he knew was Tylenol 3, one Percocet, half a \"bar\" of Xanax, one Seroquel and somewhat arbitrarily, he felt, three Advil, then turned off the light, feeling it was hurting his eyes. After blearily looking at the internet a little, then peeing and brushing his teeth and washing his face, he lay in darkness on his mattress, finally allowing the simple insistence of the opioid, like an unending chord progression with a consistently unexpected and pleasing manner of postponing resolution, to accumulate and expand, until his brain and heart and the rest of him were contained within the same song-like beating—of another, larger, protective heart—inside of which, temporarily safe from the outside world, he would shrink into the lunar city of himself and feel and remember strange and forgotten things, mostly from his childhood.[PAUL] Posted by Nate at 9:10 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "dd: PAUL",
    "text": "dd: PAUL Tuesday, November 20, 2018 PAUL Paul’s father was 28 and Paul’s mother was 24 when they alone (out of a combined fifteen to twenty-five siblings) left Taiwan for America. Paul was born in Virginia six years later, in 1983, when his brother was 7. Paul was 3 when the family moved to Apopka, a pastoral suburb near Orlando, Florida.Paul cried the first day of preschool for around ten minutes after his mother, who was secretly watching and also crying, seemed to have left. It was their first time apart. Paul’s mother watched as the principal cajoled Paul into interacting with his classmates, among whom he was well liked and popular, if a bit shy and “disengaged, sometimes,” said one of the high school students who worked at the preschool, which was called the Discovery Center. Each day, after that, Paul cried less and transitioned more abruptly from crying to interacting with classmates, and by the middle of the second week he didn’t cry anymore. At home, where mostly only Mandarin was spoken, Paul was loud and either slug-like or, his mother would say in English, “hyperactive,” rarely walking to maneuver through the house, only crawling, rolling like a log, sprinting, hopping, or climbing across sofas, counters, tables, chairs, etc. in a game called “don’t touch the ground.” Whenever motionless and not asleep or sleepy, lying on carpet in sunlight, or in bed with eyes open, bristling with undirectionalized momentum, he would want to intensely sprint in all directions simultaneously, with one unit of striving, never stopping. He would blurrily anticipate this unimaginably worldward action, then burst off his bed to standing position, or make a loud noise and violently spasm, or jolt from the carpet into a sprint, flailing his arms, feeling always incompletely satisfied.Paul’s first grade teacher recommended he be placed in the English-as-second-language program, widely viewed as for “impaired” students, but Paul’s mother kept him in the normal class. His second grade teacher recommended he be tested for the “gifted” program and he was admitted and began going every Friday to gifted, in which most of the twenty-five to thirty students, having begun in first grade, were already friends. Paul felt alone on Fridays, but not lonely or uncomfortable or anxious, only that he was in a new and challenging situation without assistance or consequence for failure—a feeling not unlike playing a difficult Nintendo game alone, with no instruction manual. Paul played chess one Friday with Barry, who suggested Paul’s second move. Barry knew more about chess, so was being helpful, Paul thought, and did as suggested for his third move also, then watched an extremely happy Barry dash through the rectangular classroom telling groups of classmates he’d beaten Paul in a four-move check-mate. Paul told three classmates Barry had “tricked him,” then returned to the floor and put the chess pieces away and, with a sensation of seeing a spider crawl out of view inside his room, felt himself reassimilating Barry into the world as a kind of robot-like presence he would always need to be careful around and would never comprehend. In third grade, one morning, Paul finished telling something to his friend Chris, who was strangely unresponsive for a few seconds, then with an exaggeratedly disgusted expression told Paul his breath smelled “horrible” and “brush your teeth,” then turned 180 degrees, in his seat, to talk to someone else. Paul mechanically committed to always brushing his teeth and adjusted his view of Chris to include him, with Barry and 90 to 95 percent of people he’d met, as separate and unknowable.In fourth grade, Paul spent two days with Lori, a second grader in his neighborhood. Lori kissed Paul’s cheek in a tree, then in her room showed him a Mickey Mantle card from her father, who’d said Mickey Mantle had the record for most RBIs. Paul, who collected baseball cards, said Hank Aaron had the record for most RBIs. Lori said he was probably right, because he was really smart. At dusk, the next day, rollerblading on the longest street in the neighborhood, Lori said she needed to try harder than Paul to go the same speed, because her legs were shorter, which Paul thought was insightful.Entering middle school, sixth to eighth grade, Paul wanted to play percussion like three of his friends, including his “best friend,” Hunter, but his piano teacher said percussion would bore him, so he chose trumpet, which he disliked, but continued playing until the summer before high school, when he switched to percussion on the first day of “band camp,” which was ten hours of practice every weekday for two weeks. During lunch break, that day, Paul was practicing alone by silently counting and sometimes tapping a cymbal with a soft-headed mallet when a senior percussionist, the section leader, began teasing him from across the room, saying he was “so cool” and something about his baggy jeans, which his skateboarding brother, at college in Philadelphia, had left in Florida. Paul was unable to think anything, except that he didn’t know what to do, at all, so he committed to doing nothing, which the senior incorporated into his teasing by focusing on how Paul was “too cool” to react, continuing for maybe thirty seconds before commenting briefly on Paul’s hair and leaving the room.Believing that all the senior’s friends and acquaintances, which included almost every person at band camp, now viewed his main effort in life as wanting to be “cool,” which he did want, to some degree, but which now seemed impossible, Paul became increasingly, physically, exclusively critically, nearly continuously self-conscious, the next few days, in ways he hadn’t been before—but probably had been in latent development since preschool—and which affected his musicianship. His middle school friends, including Hunter, among whom he’d been most fearless and at least equally competent at whatever sport or video game, watched him fail every day to play the simplest parts, usually tambourine or triangle, of each piece. The percussion instructor that year punished everyone with push-ups if one person, usually Paul, played something incorrectly more than once. Paul’s friends—subtly, then openly, with confusion and frustration—began to express disbelief at Paul’s inability to count to a number and hit a cowbell or cymbal. Paul was too embarrassed, by the end of the first week, to speak to his friends—all of whom seemed to have easily befriended the section leader and other upperclassmen—and by the second week had begun committing, in certain situations, to not speaking unless asked a question.Two months into freshman year he had committed to not speaking in almost all situations. He felt ashamed and nervous around anyone who’d known him when he was popular and unself-conscious. When he heard laughter, before he could think or feel anything, his heart would already be beating like he’d sprinted twenty yards. As the beating slowly normalized he’d think of how his heart, unlike him, was safely contained, away from the world, behind bone and inside skin, held by muscles and arteries in its place, carefully off-center, as if to artfully assert itself as source and creator, having grown the chest to hide in and to muffle and absorb—and, later, after innovating the brain and face and limbs, to convert into productive behavior—its uncontrollable, indefensible, unexplainable, embarrassing squeezing of itself. To avoid awkwardness, and in respect of his apparent aversion to speaking, Paul’s classmates stopped including him in conversations. The rare times he spoke—in classes where no one knew him, or when, without knowing why, for one to forty minutes, he’d become aggressively confident and spontaneous as he’d been in elementary/middle school, about which his friends poignantly would always seem genuinely excited—he’d feel “out of character,” indicating he’d completed a transformation and was now, in a humorlessly surreal way, exactly what he didn’t want to be and wished he wasn’t.He ate lunch alone, on benches far from the cafeteria, listening to music—his sort of refuge that was like a tunneling in his desolation toward a greater desolation, further from others and himself, closer to the shared source of everything—with portable CD players and earphones, feeling sorry for himself, or vaguely but deeply humbled, though mostly just silent and doomed. Sometimes, thinking of how among fifteen hundred classmates only two others, that he’d noticed, were as socially inept as he—a male in his grade, an obese male one grade lower—Paul would feel a blandly otherworldly excitement, like he must be in some bizarre and extended dream, or lost in the offscreen world of some fictional movie set in an adjacent county.In Paul’s sophomore or junior year he began to believe the only solution to his anxiety, low self-esteem, view of himself as unattractive, etc. would be for his mother to begin disciplining him on her own volition, without his prompting, as an unpredictable—and, maybe, to counter the previous fourteen or fifteen years of “overprotectiveness,” unfair—entity, convincingly not unconditionally supportive. His mother would need to create rules and punishments exceeding Paul’s expectations, to a degree that Paul would no longer feel in control. To do this, Paul believed, his mother would need to anticipate and preempt anything he might have considered, factoring in that—because Paul was thinking about this almost every day, and between the two of them was the source of this belief—he probably already expected, or had imagined, any rule or punishment she would be willing to instate or inflict, therefore she would need to consider rules and punishments that she would not think of herself as willing to instate or inflict. Paul tried to convey this in crying, shouting fights with his mother lasting up to four hours, sometimes five days a week. There was an inherent desperation to these fights, in that each time Paul, in frustration, told his mother how she could have punished him, in whatever previous situation, to make him feel not in control—to, he believed, help solve his social and psychological problems—it became complicatedly more difficult, in Paul’s view, for his mother to successfully preempt his expectations the next time. Paul cried and shouted more than his mother, who only shouted maybe once or twice. Paul would scream if his mother was downstairs while he was upstairs, in his room, where some nights he would throw his electric pencil sharpener and textbooks—and, once, a six-inch cymbal—at his walls, creating holes, resulting in punishments, but never exceeding what, by imagining their possibilities, he’d already rendered unsurprising, predictable. The intensity of these fights maybe contributed to Paul’s lungs collapsing spontaneously three times his senior year, when he was absent forty-seven days and in hospitals for around four weeks.One night, standing in the doorway of his parents’ bedroom, when his father was on a months-long business trip, crying while shouting at his mother, who was supine in bed, in the dark, Paul heard her softly and steadily crying, with her blanket up to her chin in a way that seemed child-like. Paul stopped shouting and stood sobbing quietly, dimly aware, as his face twitched and trembled, that he felt intensely embarrassed of himself from the perspective of any person, except his mother, he had ever met. He said he didn’t know what he was talking about, or what he should do, that he was sorry and didn’t want to complain or blame other people anymore, and felt an ambiguous relief, to have reached the end of a thing without resolution and, having tried hard, feeling allowed—and ready—to resign. He didn’t stop blaming his mother, after that, but gradually they fought less—and, after each fight, when he would revert to his belief about discipline, he would apologize and reiterate he didn’t want to blame anyone or complain—and, by the last month of senior year, had mostly stopped fighting.On one of Paul’s last days of high school he and Lori were both getting rides home from Hunter, who due to a difficulty in refusing requests from people who could see him—in elementary/middle school, whenever a mutual friend rang his doorbell, he and Paul would pretend no one was home— sometimes spent ninety minutes driving classmates home after school. The past eight years, since Lori kissed Paul on the cheek, they’d spoken maybe three times (the day after they rollerbladed together she had begun hanging out with a boy with a “rattail” hairstyle), and the most intimate Paul had been with another girl was a ten-minute conversation, at an “away” high school football game, with another percussionist.Lori repeatedly asked Paul why he wouldn’t speak and, not receiving an answer, began provoking Paul to “say anything,” seeming as committed to eliciting a response as Paul was to not responding. Lori was loudly asking, with genuine and undistracted and bemused curiosity, which Paul felt affection toward and admired, as he stared away from her, out his window, why he couldn’t speak—and if he could just “make any noise”—when Hunter, who’d been talking to someone in the front passenger seat, sort of forced Lori to stop by aggressively asking about her current boyfriend. As he had consistently, the past eight to ten years, Paul felt endeared by Hunter, who used to be an equal, but now—and for the past three or four years—was like an overworked stepfather or sensitive uncle to Paul, the mentally disabled stepson or silent, troubling nephew.[BUY GUACAMOLE FOR DANIEL] Posted by Nate at 9:14 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

Sitting cross-legged on the sidewalk against a Thai restaurant was a girl with dyed-black hair. As Paul approached she looked up knowingly with an innocent, wary gaze.“Hi,” said Paul. “Are you Fran?”“Yeah,” said Fran.“I’m Paul.”“I know,” said Fran, and slowly closed her notebook.“Are you doing homework?”“My friend’s homework.”“Nice,” said Paul staring transfixed at Fran’s delicate and extreme gaze, like that of a skeleton with eyeballs, or a person with their face peeled off. Paul began talking—slowly, before accelerating to a normal speed—about how Daniel had sounded “really drunk” on the phone but had sent witty, insightful, elaborate texts of mostly long, elegant sentences. Fran said Daniel was like that when on Klonopin. Paul asked if he could have a Klonopin and Fran gave him one and looked to his left, where he was surprised to see Daniel standing in place, a few feet away, looking at Fran with the fixed, discerning, earnest gaze of a three-year-old processing information without considering utility or personal relevance. Paul asked Daniel how many Klonopin he had taken.“Five,” said Daniel.“Jesus,” said Paul.

    "text": "dd: GO TO DANIEL'S APARTMENT Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO TO DANIEL'S APARTMENT Daniel’s two suitemates were seated at a round, thin, foldable table on chairs Paul immediately viewed as “found on the street,” talking to each other, it seemed, after returning from a concert. Except for a broom and what Daniel confirmed—grimly, Paul felt—was a giant plastic eggplant of unknown origin, there was nothing else in the common room.Daniel’s room had a dresser, mattress pad, wood chair, tiny desk. Within arm’s reach, outside his window, was a brick wall covered with gradients of gray ash. Daniel showed Paul, who felt self-conscious and crowded, standing in place, a candle shaped like a lightbulb and said it was from his sister. Paul stared at it, unable to comprehend, in a way that made the behavior seem unreal, exactly why Daniel was showing it to him, with a feeling that he’d misheard, or not heard, something Daniel said a few seconds or minutes ago.“Maybe we should just get drunk,” said Daniel, and they entered the kitchen at the end of the hallway. While sitting on an upturned milk crate apparently serving as a stool, Paul felt surreally distant from Daniel—staring into his refrigerator—and like he, in a moment of inattention, might either fall asleep or \"snap awake\" from what increasingly felt like a dream. In the bathroom Paul sat on the toilet for between five and forty seconds then stared at himself in the mirror catatonically for a vague amount of time, aware of something simian about his posture and jaw. When Paul returned, after flushing the toilet and washing his hands for what seemed like ten seconds, he found Daniel in his room lying on his mattress with the light off, watching something on Paul's Macbook. Paul felt himself becoming aware, in a manner that seemed sourceless, that they were now alone in the apartment, and felt himself say, at a sub-speaking volume to himself, it seemed, “I think I feel depleted.”“What do you mean?”“I feel kind of tired, depleted.”“I'm surprised you're even awake right now.”“Huh?” said Paul. “I had two capsules of DMZ I forgot I'd left in your jacket last night, then outside the library you found and ate them.”Paul laughed. “I forgot.”“Jesus. You scare me.”“Sorry,” said Paul grinning, thinking he had definitely read about \"DMZ\" somewhere, but was now content with dismissing any further thoughts on the matter as Daniel seemingly had. Paul sat against the wall—lit by Paul's Macbook from an unknown source that cyclically pulsed from a near-ultraviolet purple to dark red—next to Daniel's mattress. Paul took out his phone and emailed himself—I’m sitting against a wall Feel strongly like I simply want to relate my feelings of bleakness in this emailMy legs feel cold—with “Feeling bleak” as the subject. He was lying on his back looking at Twitter, a few minutes later, when for the fifth or sixth time since getting it in January he dropped his iPhone on his face, which did not register in its expression that anything had happened until after impact. He considered emailing himself that his iPhone fell on his face. Then he tried to do what he couldn’t specifically remember having done since college—he chose one of his favorite songs and, with a meekly earnest sympathy toward himself, listened to it on repeat at a high volume and tried to focus only on the drums, or bass guitar, until he was drowsy and decontextualized and memoryless, when he would half-unconsciously remove his  earphones and turn off the music, careful not to be noticed and assimilated by the world, and disappear into the reachable mirage of sleep.But he couldn’t focus on the music. He couldn’t ignore a feeling that he wasn’t alone—that, in the brain of the universe, where everything that happened was concurrently recorded as public and indestructible data, he was already partially with everyone else that had died. The information of his existence, the etching of which into space-time was his experience of life, was being studied by millions of entities, billions of years from now, who knew him better than he would ever know himself. They knew everything about him, even his current thoughts, in their exact vagueness, as he moved distractedly toward sleep, studying him in their equivalent of middle school “maybe,” thought some fleeting aspect of Paul’s consciousness, unaware what it was referencing. <DMZ Dream Packet 1> [?] Posted by Nate at 9:37 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Older Post Home"

The room was palely lit by a cloudy, faintly pink morning. Paul’s MacBook, in front of them, showed Drugstore Cowboy’s menu screen. Paul shifted a little—his right leg was numb—and Daniel began talking in a clear voice, as if he’d been awake a few minutes already. Daniel wanted to ingest Adderall instead of sleep. Paul, who couldn’t remember if they’d watched the movie, distractedly asked what they would do “all day.”“What we normally do. Walk around. Fix my computer.”“I feel . . . sleepy,” said Paul.Daniel said something about Adderall.“I feel like I’ll still be sleepy,” said Paul.“You’ll be awake, trust me.”“I’m not sure if I want to.”“I feel like you’re eight years old or my girlfriend,” said Daniel around five minutes later.“I really don’t know what I want to do,” said Paul grinning.[FIX DANIEL'S COMPUTER] at November 21, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: FIX DANIEL'S COMPUTER",
    "text": "D: FIX DANIEL'S COMPUTER Thursday, November 22, 2018 FIX DANIEL'S COMPUTER An hour later, after each showering at his own apartment, they met and ingested Adderall and walked to Verb, a café without internet, where they drank iced coffee and ingested a little more Adderall, then went in an adjacent bookstore, where Daniel showed Paul a translated book of nonfiction with a similar cover—off-center black dot, white background—as Shawn Olive’s poetry book.“That’s funny,” said Paul grinning, and they got on the L train, then walked to the Apple store on Prince Street. Daniel’s MacBook, which had files he needed for his job as a research assistant to an elderly ghostwriter (of sports autobiographies) who owed him $200, would require two weeks to be fixed. Daniel asked if Paul would go with him to Rhode Island, in three hours, to stay with Fran’s family for a weekend. Paul declined, saying he hadn’t been invited. Daniel said he confirmed last week but didn’t want to go anymore and that, a few minutes ago, Fran texted she couldn’t, against expectation, get any Oxycodone—without which it was going to be “unbearable,” Daniel felt, for both himself and Fran, to be around Fran’s family. Paul declined again, saying it seemed stressful. It began raining from a partly sunny sky, and they went in an Urban Outfitters. Daniel walked to a table of books and stood without looking at anything, like a tired child waiting for an overbearingly upbeat mother to finish shopping.“You seem worried,” said Paul.“Sorry. I’m trying to think of an excuse to tell Fran.”     It was sunny and cloudless, around twenty minutes later, when they sat side by side on a bench in Washington Square Park. Daniel swallowed something and mutely handed Paul a 20mg Adderall, which Paul swallowed. Two preadolescent girls ran around the fountain area repeatedly. Paul said he felt like he hadn’t run as fast as possible in probably five or ten years. When the Adderall took effect Daniel began to praise Paul’s writing without restraint or pause for twenty to thirty minutes and asked about Paul’s IQ. Paul said it was either 139 or 154. Daniel was quiet a few seconds, then with a slightly troubled expression said his IQ was higher, seeming like he felt more complicatedly doomed, as a person, with this information. Paul said his mother always said that his and his brother’s IQs were exactly the same, but sometimes also said she was required, as a parent, to say that.Daniel said his sister had multiple doctorates, his parents and aunts and uncles were all high-level professors, but he was “not anything.” Paul knew from previous conversations that Daniel, as a teenager, had been on months-long retreats to Buddhist monasteries, culminating in something like a year alone, when he turned 18, in India or Tibet. Daniel walked away to call Fran and Paul googled for \"DMZ\" on his phone without success. Daniel returned and said he told Fran his computer had to be fixed today, or not for two weeks, and he needed it to do work, because he hadn’t paid last month’s rent, so wasn’t going to Rhode Island, and that “she got really angry.”“I feel like you did the right thing . . . I mean . . . outside of being honest,” said Paul grinning. “Your relationship with her is more accurate now.”“Your use of the word ‘accurate’ is interesting.”“She has a more accurate view of your view of her now probably,” said Paul. <DMZ DREAM PACKET 2>[SEE TRASH HUMPERS] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "text": "D: SEE TRASH HUMPERS Thursday, November 22, 2018 SEE TRASH HUMPERS A week later Paul had organized plans to see Trash Humpers and was waiting for Fran and Daniel at the theater. Fran gave Paul six 10mg Adderall for her and Daniel’s tickets and a disoriented-seeming Daniel, who had no money left, asked if Paul had any snacks. Paul gave Daniel a sugar-free Red Bull he got from a Red Bull–shaped car parked outside the library and Daniel drank it in one motion with a neutral expression.“Fran said she’ll pay you back if you give me one of the Adderall she gave you,” whispered Daniel a few minutes into the movie. “I don’t think I can stay awake without it.” In the movie costumed actors made noises in parking lots and inside houses while destroying and/or “humping” inanimate objects. Paul woke, at one point, to Fran laughing loudly when no one else in the small, sold-out theater was laughing. When Paul wasn’t asleep he felt distracted by a feeling that Daniel had eerily turned his head 90 degrees and was staring at him, but each time he looked Daniel was either asleep or looking at the screen. The last ten minutes of the movie Paul was peripherally aware of Daniel’s unsupported head continually lolling in place and twitching to attention in a manner reminiscent of a middle/high school student struggling and repeatedly failing to remain awake in a morning class. Daniel seemed fully alert seconds after the movie ended. Paul asked how he slept despite Adderall and Red Bull.“Susie-Q,” said Daniel with a smirk-like grin indicating both earnest disapproval and a kind of fondness toward Seroquel and its intense, often uncomfortable tranquilizing  effects—as if, believing Susie-Q wasn’t malicious, he could forgive her every time she induced twelve hours of sleep followed by twelve to twenty-four hours of feeling lost and irritable, therefore she functioned, if inadvertently, as a teacher of forgiveness and acceptance and empathy, for which he was grateful.They were the last three people, after the movie, to leave the theater. They stood on the sidewalk, unsure what to do next. Fran had planned to go to Coney Island tonight and stay until morning for her birthday, which was today—she’d created a Facebook listing, which Paul remembered seeing—but none of her friends wanted to go, because she didn’t have any, she said. Paul said he also had no friends and that they should celebrate by “eating a lot of food.”At Lovin’ Cup, a bar-restaurant with live music, Fran and Daniel ordered drinks, went outside to smoke. Paul laid the side of his head on his arms, on the table, and closed his eyes. He didn’t feel connected by a traceable series of linked events to a source that had purposefully conveyed him, from elsewhere, into this world. He felt like a digression that had forgotten from what it digressed and was continuing ahead in a confused, choiceless searching.

    "title": "D: PARTY",
    "text": "D: PARTY Thursday, November 22, 2018 PARTY At a party, three days later, Paul met Taryn, a friend of Caroline and Shawn Olive’s, and became gradually—almost unnoticeably—intrigued by their interactions. They rarely talked and never touched but remained, for some reason, near each other, as if one was the other’s manager or personal assistant, but neither knew their role and could only study the other for clues, which they seemed to do, gazing at each other anthropomorphically, for seconds at a time, surprisingly without awkwardness, then she seemed to disappear and was quickly forgotten. Paul sat with strangers on a crowded staircase and drank a beer while looking at his phone, sometimes staring at its screen for ten to twenty seconds without thinking anything, before maneuvering through a crowded hallway into a medium-size room. Around twenty-five people were dancing to loud music with faces that seemed expressive in an emotionless, hidden, bone-ward manner—the faces of people with the ability to stop clutching the objects of themselves and allow their brains, like independent universes with unique and inconstant natural laws, to react, like trees to wind, with their bodies to music.Paul walked directly to a two-seat sofa (golden brown and deeply padded as the upturned paw of an enormous stuffed animal) and lay on it, on his side, facing the room, and closed his eyes. After a blip of surprise, which disintegrated in some chemical system of Klonopin and Valium and alcohol instead of articulating into what would’ve startled Paul awake—that he’d fluently, with precision and total calm, entered a room of dozens of people and lain facing outward on a sofa—was asleep. When he woke, an unknown amount of time later—  between five and forty minutes, or longer—he observed neutrally that, though he was drooling a little and probably the only non-dancing person in the room, no one was looking at him, then moved toward the room’s iPod with the goal-oriented, zombie-like calmness of a person who has woken at night thirsty and is walking to his refrigerator and changed the music to “Today” by the Smashing Pumpkins. Every person, it seemed, stopped dancing and appeared earnestly annoyed but—as if to avoid encouraging the behavior—didn’t look at Paul or say anything and, when the music was changed back, resumed dancing, like nothing had happened.<DMZ DREAM PACKET 3>[??????] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: ??????",
    "text": "D: ?????? Thursday, November 22, 2018 ?????? In early June, after four more parties, two at which he similarly slept on sofas after walking mutely through rooms without looking at anyone, Paul began attending fewer social gatherings and ingesting more drugs, mostly with Daniel and Fran, or only Daniel, or sometimes alone, which seemed classically “not a good sign,” he sometimes thought, initially with mild amusement, then as a neutral observation, finally as a meaningless placeholder. Due to his staggered benzodiazepine usage and lack of obligations or long-term projects and that he sometimes ingested Seroquel and slept twelve to sixteen hours (always waking, it seemed, at night, uncomfortable and disoriented and unsure what to do, usually returning to sleep) he had gradually become unaware of day-to-day or week-to-week changes in his life—and, when he thought of himself in terms of months and years, he still viewed himself as in an “interim period,” which by definition, he felt, would end when his book tour began—so he viewed the trend, of fewer people and more drugs, as he might view a new waiter at Taco Chulo: “there, at some point,” separate from him, not of his concern, beyond his ability or desire to track or control.When he wanted to know what happened two days ago, or five hours ago, especially chronologically, he would sense an impasse, in the form of a toll, which hadn’t been there before, payable by an amount of effort (not unlike that required in problem solving or essay writing) he increasingly felt unmotivated to exert. There were times when his memory, like an external hard drive that had been taken from him and hidden inside an unwieldy series of cardboard boxes, or placed at the end of a long and dark and messy corridor, required much more effort than he felt motivated to exert simply to locate, after which, he knew, more effort would be required to gain access. After two to five hours with no memory, some days, he would begin to view concrete reality as his memory—a place to explore idly, without concern, but somewhat pointlessly, aware that his actual existence was elsewhere, that he was, in a way, hiding here, away from where things actually happened, then were stored here, in his memory.Having repeatedly learned from literature, poetry, philosophy, popular culture, his own experiences, most movies he’d seen, especially ones he liked, that it was desirable to “live in the present,” “not dwell on the past,” etc., he mostly viewed these new obstacles to his memory as friendly and, sometimes, momentarily believing in their viability as a form of Zen, exciting or at least interesting. Whenever he wanted to access his memory (usually to analyze or calmly replay a troubling or pleasant social interaction) and sensed the impasse, which he almost always did, to some degree, or that his memory was currently missing, as was increasingly the case, he would allow himself to stop wanting, with an ease, not unlike dropping a leaf or stick while outdoors, he hadn’t felt before—and, partly because he’d quickly forget what he’d wanted, without a sensation of loss or worry, only an acknowledgment of a different distribution of consciousness than if he’d focused on assembling and sustaining a  memory—and passively continue with his ongoing sensory perception of concrete reality.In mid-June, one dark and rainy afternoon, Paul woke and rolled onto his side and opened his MacBook sideways. At some point, maybe twenty minutes after he’d begun refreshing Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Gmail in a continuous cycle—with an ongoing, affectless, humorless realization that his day “was over”—he noticed with confusion, having thought it was a.m., that it was 4:46 p.m. He slept until 8:30 p.m. and “worked on things” in the library until midnight and was two blocks from his room, carrying a mango and two cucumbers and a banana in a plastic bag, when Daniel texted “come hang out, Mitch bought a lot of coke.” [COCAINE] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "text": "D: COCAINE Thursday, November 22, 2018 COCAINE Daniel and Mitch were outside a bar, discussing where to use the cocaine. Paul said Daniel looked “really tired” and asked if he needed some eggplant, in reference to a joke they had that Daniel was heavily dependent on eggplant and almost always suffering its withdrawal symptoms, which could be horrific. Daniel said he stayed up last night with Fran, currently sleeping, to celebrate, by eating brunch and buying drugs, that she’d quit her job she got three days ago waitressing in a Polish restaurant.They crossed the street to Mitch’s friend Harry’s apartment, where Harry, whom Mitch had earlier given some cocaine for his birthday, was repeatedly trying to hug more than one person at a time while shouting what one would normally speak. Paul walked aimlessly, into a kitchen, where he stood in darkness at the sink peeling and eating his mango. He washed his hands and walked through the apartment’s main room—two desktop computers and speakers on a corner table, four large windows overlooking Graham Avenue, ten to fifteen people hugging and shouting, two mediumsize  dogs—into an institutionally bright hallway, where he heard Daniel in a bathroom whose door wasn’t fully closed. “It’s me,” said Paul, and pushed the door, against resistance, which relented when he said “it’s Paul,” revealing a vaguely familiar girl, who appeared extremely tired, sitting on a bathtub’s outer edge, looking at Daniel and Mitch huddled on the floor around a toilet-seat lid with cocaine on it.“You’re doing it without me,” said Paul in an exaggerated monotone.“We thought you left,” said Daniel.“I wouldn’t just leave,” said Paul.“Out of anyone I know you’re probably most likely to just leave,” said Daniel crushing cocaine with his debit card.Paul looked at the girl, who shrugged.Mitch, who was allergic to Harry’s dogs, sneezed.“Jesus, be careful,” said Daniel quietly.“He’s sharing it with us,” said Paul. “And all you can do is berate him.”“Bro,” said Daniel, and seemed to grin at Paul a little.At Legion, twenty minutes later, Paul was sitting alone on a padded seat, staring at an area of torsos that were beginning to seem face-like. He texted Daniel that he was going to Khim’s to “stock up on eggplant” and walked six blocks to the large deli below Harry’s apartment, feeling energetic and calm, listening to Rilo Kiley through earphones at a medium volume. He paid for an organic beef patty, two kombuchas, five bananas, alfalfa sprouts, arugula, hempseed oil, a red onion, ginger, toilet paper and carried two paper bags reinforced with plastic bags toward Legion. Harry approached on the sidewalk with a panic-like expression of uncommitted confusion and, staring ahead, passed with a sweating forehead like the person in Go who is abandoned by a friend in  an alleyway outside a rave while—due to too much ecstasy—foaming at the mouth.Mitch and Daniel, in the soundless distance, were outside Legion. As Paul approached, crossing a street, Daniel entered Legion. Mitch said they were openly snorting cocaine off a table in the back room, because the bathroom line was too long, when a security guard approached and Mitch threw the bag of cocaine (which Daniel was currently trying to find) under a table, or somewhere. They crossed the street, went in White Castle, sat in a booth. Paul realized a poster said “chicken rings” not “onion rings” and said it seemed “insane” and speculated on the process that must be required of making the meat into a paste to mold into rings.“I’m worried about Daniel,” said Mitch.“He has a warrant for his arrest in Colorado, I think,” said Paul.“Jesus,” said Mitch.“It’s probably better if he goes to jail instead of you. He’s unemployed and in debt to like five people. He has a seventy-dollar tab with me. I think he needs six hundred dollars in one week for overdue rent. You have a real job and a nice apartment. If he goes to jail I’ll relinquish his tab.”Mitch was fidgeting a little.“We can make a blog about him and mail him letters,” said Paul.“A blog,” said Mitch. “Jesus.”“I’m going to look for him,” said Paul.In Legion’s bathroom Paul read a text from Daniel that said “come outside.” Daniel, on the sidewalk, seeing Paul, began crossing the street, toward White Castle, looking in different directions while saying he knew the bouncers at Legion and  that Mitch shouldn’t have panicked. Paul said Mitch had a high-paying job.“Where is he?”“White Castle,” said Paul.“Should I get some of this coke? I could’ve gotten in trouble.”“Yeah. If that’s what you want.”“He’s lucky it landed on this little ledge,” said Daniel staring ahead as White Castle passed on their left. “I don’t think any was lost.”“My groceries are in White Castle. Where are you going?”“Let’s go to your room to do some of this coke,” said Daniel.“It’s too far,” said Paul slowing his pace.“We’ll go there and come back, it won’t take long.”“It’s way too far,” said Paul. “Just snort it off your hand.”They were on a dark street with no people, moving cars, or stores. Daniel’s head seemed more elevated than normal—and his neck, swiveling and ostrich-like, more mechanical and controlled—as he looked in different directions while removing cocaine from the bag with what seemed to be his fingers, then somehow maneuvering his hand into a fist, which he put into his jeans pocket. Paul felt unsettled, imagining amounts of cocaine trickling between fingers and slipping off the sides of fingers and the curve of the palm and sticking as powder against Daniel’s hand and pocket interior. Paul ripped a page from his Moleskine journal and said “here, use this.” Daniel continued looking in different directions a few seconds before taking the page and putting it directly in his pants pocket.“You should snort it off the Lincoln,” said Paul.“There isn’t a Lincoln here,” said Daniel.“That looks like a Lincoln,” said Paul pointing.“That’s a Pontiac,” said Daniel looking elsewhere.“You should hide between two cars,” said Paul, and Daniel moved slowly toward the street. Paul used his phone to photograph Daniel kneeling between two cars and sent the photo to his own Gmail account and to Daniel’s phone. He imagined them both sprinting in different directions the instant a spotlight appeared, gliding across the street, toward them, from a low-flying helicopter.“Good job,” said Paul walking toward White Castle.“You know I don’t usually do this to friends,” said Daniel staring ahead.“What do you mean?” said Paul grinning.“I mean, do you think it’s okay I did that?”“Yeah. You were put in a dangerous situation.”“I was looking on the ground for it, but it was on this little shelf,” said Daniel in White Castle.“Jesus,” said Mitch, who seemed distracted in a respiratory manner like, after Paul left, he’d become increasingly worried and hyperventilated a little and was still recovering. Daniel handed Mitch the bag and said “um, it was open, so I don’t know how much fell out,” with, it seemed, slightly averted eyes. Mitch put the bag in his pocket without responding and, with unfocused eyes, said he was going to the bathroom and went.After snorting cocaine in Paul’s room Daniel and Mitch moved into the kitchen, then into Caroline’s room. Caroline’s door, except when she was sleeping, was always partly open. Paul, whose door was almost always closed, listened from his mattress and when he heard someone say “chicken rings” stood without thinking and went to Caroline’s room. Daniel and Mitch were aggressively looking at Caroline’s shelves and walls, bending at their waists and craning their necks.“Hi, Paul,” said Caroline.“Hi. I heard someone say ‘chicken rings.’ ”“Chicken rings?” said Caroline.“I think I misheard,” said Paul. “Never mind.”“Caroline was telling us she went to a Fuck Buttons concert tonight,” said Mitch.“Someone was talking about them before,” said Paul vaguely. “I feel like . . . Daniel . . . you were telling me about them. Fuck Buttons.”“I don’t think so,” said Daniel.“Last night, maybe,” said Paul.“Where were we last night?”“Um,” said Paul looking down with unfocused eyes, aware he looked like he was thinking but wasn’t, an increasingly common deception for him. “I don’t know,” he said after a few seconds, then said “Shawn Olive” as a non sequitur and grinned and said “Daniel knows Shawn Olive” to Caroline, who had gone to school with Shawn Olive.“Who’s Shawn Olive?” said Mitch.“I don’t know,” said Paul immediately while laughing a little. “I mean . . . seems hard to just answer that.”“We’re good friends,” said Caroline. “He’s great.”“We saw Robin Hood last night,” said Daniel.Paul was alone, a few hours later, stomach-down on his bed, working on things on his MacBook—on 20mg Adderall—after eating most of his organic beef patty with an arugula salad containing flax seeds, alfalfa sprouts, cucumber, tamari, lemon juice, flax oil. He and Daniel, who’d left around 3:30 a.m. with Mitch, had been emailing steadily and were committed to meet at 9:30 a.m. to go to the Museum of Modern Art, where Marina Abramović was performing The Artist Is Present, for which she would be sitting in a chair for 736 hours over 77 days, staring at whoever was next in line to sit and stare back at her from an opposite chair. When Paul emailed Daniel at 9:22 a.m. that he was naked and hadn’t showered Daniel responded that he was also naked and also hadn’t showered. At 9:54 a.m. Paul texted “where the fuck are you.” Daniel responded immediately that he was still naked and hadn’t moved from his bed.They met, an hour later, at an intersection near the Graham L train stop. One of them said the museum would be crowded on a Sunday and, within seconds, both had strongly committed to not going. They went to the bookstore adjacent Verb. “Shawn Olive,” said Daniel holding the book with a black dot on its cover toward Paul and grinning. “Shawn Olive’s book has the same cover. Almost the same cover.”“We already showed each other that,” said Paul.“What do you mean?”“We showed each other this book. Are you joking?”“No,” said Daniel. “We talked about this book?”“We talked about it where we’re standing right now.”“Damn,” said Daniel looking away. “I don’t remember.” [SELL BOOKS] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: SELL BOOKS",
    "text": "D: SELL BOOKS Thursday, November 22, 2018 SELL BOOKS At Verb they each ingested 10mg Adderall. Daniel removed from his tote bag a glass jar with a peanut butter label and, with a neutral expression, not looking at Paul, poured around 4oz of whiskey into his iced coffee. Paul asked what Daniel was going to do about his financial situation. Daniel said Mitch, a week ago, had mentioned hiring him to write promotional copy for his band but hadn’t mentioned it again. Paul suggested they shoplift things from Best Buy, or some other store, to sell on eBay.Outside, walking steadily but aimlessly, they entered East River State Park and sat on grass, facing the river and Manhattan, which seemed to Paul like an enormous, unfinished cruise ship that had been disassembled and rearranged by thousands of disconnected organizations. They decided to sell books on the sidewalk, on Bedford Avenue, but continued sitting. Daniel began talking, a few minutes later, in a quiet, earnest voice about his lack of accomplishments in life, staring into the distance with a haunted, slightly puzzled expression, seeming at times like he might begin crying. Paul, grinning anxiously at Daniel’s right profile, unsure what to say, or do, shrugged more than once, thinking that tears would have a restorative effect on the seared dryness of Daniel’s eyes, which looked like they’d been baked at a low heat.“What were we doing now?” said Paul leaving the park, around twenty minutes later.Daniel looked distractedly in both directions after walking a few steps onto a street, then turned right on the sidewalk, staring ahead with a worried expression.“We had a specific goal, I remember,” said Paul. “What was it?”“I don’t know,” said Daniel after a few seconds.“We were just talking about it.”“I remember something,” said Daniel absently.“Oh yeah, selling books,” said Paul.“Let’s do that,” said Daniel.“We just actually forgot our purpose, then regained it,” said Paul grinning. “We still kept moving at the same speed, when we had no goal.”“Jesus,” said Daniel quietly.On the way to Paul’s room, to get books to sell, they went in a pizza restaurant, because Daniel was hungry. Paul was staring through glass at a pigeon eating specks off the sidewalk when he noticed the approach of what he briefly, with some sarcasm, began to perceive as another pigeon, inside the restaurant, but was Daniel. “Um, so, my debit card, either from cutting so much blow or being maxed out, isn’t working,” he said in a quiet, controlled voice with an earnest expression. “Could I borrow $2.75 for a slice of pizza?”“Yeah,” said Paul thinking he wasn’t going to mention the pigeon illusion. “I’ll add it to your tab.”Daniel stood near the center of Paul’s room quietly saying that he felt “fucked” about his financial situation and generally, in terms of his life, then kneeled to a low table to organize two lines of cocaine with the last of what he had from Mitch’s bag. Paul, stomach-down on his mattress, asked what music he should play and clicked “Heartbeats” by the Knife. They both laughed a little and Paul clicked “Last Nite” by the Strokes and said it sounded too depressing. He clicked “Such Great Heights” by The Postal Service and said “just kidding.” He clicked “The Peter Criss Jazz” by Don Caballero. He clicked “pause.”Daniel said to put The Postal Service back on and snorted half his line. Paul moved a rolled-up page of Shawn Olive’s poetry book in his right nostril toward the cocaine and exhaled a little after snorting half his line, causing the rest and some of Daniel’s to spread in a poof on the table. Daniel lightly berated Paul, who sort of rolled toward his mattress’s center, then—liking the feeling of unimpeded motion on a padded  surface—moved his MacBook to the floor and lay in a diagonal on his back with his limbs spread out a little, which felt interesting because, he knew, it was probably the second or third time he’d lain on this mattress, while awake and alert and not impatient toward himself, without reading a book, looking at his MacBook, or aware of his MacBook’s screen.At a certain age, he remembered, he had often lain motionless on carpet, or a sofa, feeling what he probably viewed, at the time, as boredom and what now seemed like ignorance of—or passive disbelief in—his forthcoming death, which would occur regardless of his thoughts, feelings, or actions in the unknown amount of remaining interim, upon a binary absorption from some incomprehensible direction, taking him elsewhere. Briefly, without much interest, Paul intuited that if he were immortal, or believed he was, he might feel what he’d felt as a child, which seemed less enjoyable than obscurely unsatisfying, something he’d want to be distracted from feeling. After a few minutes an out-of-view Daniel continued to say he felt depressed, but in a calmer voice that Paul felt was “soothing,” for him, to hear, from his bed.They sat facing south at Bedford and North 1st with thirty to forty books on a rollout carpet and, in a few hours, sold around $25 of books and $60 of Paul’s Adderall, which he received monthly by mail at slightly-better-than-drug-dealer price from a graduate student at Boston College. Four fashionable black teenagers appeared and, Paul thought, “the leader,” who was much more interested than the others, asked if he could “sample” Charles’ book.“I’ll take it,” he said after laughing loudly at something in the book, which included poetry and prose about alienation, boredom, science fiction, depression, confusion.Daniel asked if the teenager liked Adderall.“What is it?”Daniel described it in a few sentences.“So, it’s like ecstasy?”“Sort of,” said Daniel. “But without the euphoria. It’s good for doing work. It helps you focus.”The teenager asked if his friend was “in.”“No,” said his friend. “But I’ll watch you do it.”“Do you want your book signed? The author is here,” said Paul pointing at Daniel, who had been pretending he was Charles, with Charles’ approval gained by text.Daniel wrote “best wishes, from Charles” in the book.Charles’ six weeks in Mexico and Guatemala, related in emails and Gmail chats, traveling hostel to hostel, spending much of his time in internet cafés feeling alienated from Americans doing what he was doing, but in groups, had taken on the tone and focus, after two weeks, of a comedic sitcom, which he’d named <em>Avoiding Jehan</em>, because his primary concern, most days, was to avoid or endure or try to permanently escape a person named Jehan, who had repeatedly—almost always inadvertently, obliviously—thwarted Charles’ few romantic prospects and, in social situations, caused Charles to become “the third wheel” or “the fifth wheel.” In one email Charles had wished Jehan would “become invisible.” After getting stalled in Guatemala, on the way to South America, two weeks ago, Charles had returned cashless to his girlfriend and Seattle, where they now shared “a smaller, shittier apartment,” he said, than when he left America, around two months ago.The sky had begun to colorfully darken, a few hours later, with reds and purples and pinks that drifted away, like cotton candy, from an unseen horizon, as if something there was changing and releasing energy, when an Asian girl, who had slowed and passed a minute ago while talking into an iPhone, returned and said she recognized Paul from the internet and distractedly asked if Daniel was a cop.“No,” said Daniel, and the Asian girl said she was buying marijuana from someone with a business card, which she showed Daniel, at his request. She bought two books and three Adderall and kneeled and asked if Daniel or Paul had a driver’s license, to move her friend’s car from Crown Heights to the Graham L train station for money. They discussed the car for what seemed like fifteen minutes, without resolution, then the girl, whose name was Abbie, which Paul heard initially as Addy, removed a Chinese magazine from her bag and asked if Paul was good at translating. Paul said he couldn’t read Chinese or speak Mandarin fluently, and had an American accent sometimes, he’d been told. “I’m going to pee,” he said, and went to Verb, two blocks away. In line, behind two people, he thought that, from a certain point onward—beginning with his book tour, maybe—he would only appear in public if he’d ingested sufficient drugs to not primarily be a source of anxiety, bleakness, awkwardness, etc. for himself and/or others.When Paul returned to Daniel and Abbie they were talking about Abbie’s boyfriend, who had attended the same college as Daniel, in Colorado. Abbie’s boyfriend had gone to India after college. When he returned to America, three years ago, he died for a reason that Paul, who was thinking of how spring was to summer like a morning was to an entire day, brief and lucid and transitional, didn’t hear. Abbie said her boyfriend’s funeral, due to a request he’d made in India, had been organized and promoted like a party and was “weird,” because it had been exactly like a party except everyone was wearing black.<DMZ DREAM PACKET 4> [????] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "text": "D: ???? Thursday, November 22, 2018 ???? In mid-July, a few weeks later, at a party that, instead of ending, had moved outside, through a window at the back of someone’s bedroom, onto an eighth-floor roof, Paul and Daniel were on an additionally elevated platform—corner-set, wall-less, square, smooth—like a landing pad for tiny helicopters.Daniel was standing with limbs and neck uncoordinatedly extended, slightly striding in place—the pre-predatory stance of a chained thing that had broken free and didn’t yet know where to direct its vengeance, or what to do generally. His vision was focused horizontally, as if across a flat expanse. Then, with his back to one of the two edges dropping to the street, he approached an already fearful Paul—sitting cross-legged at the platform’s center, aware Daniel had been drinking steadily for hours and was probably on two or more drugs—who reacted preemptively, against what seemed like a purposeless entity unreasonably desiring his involvement, with defensive movements of his arms and hands, causing the situation, in Paul’s panicked state, to immediately seem like an unrestrained wrestling, though it probably looked more like an exaggeratedly confused handshaking. Paul tried to concentrate on flattening himself—on retaining a low, stable center—while repeatedly telling Daniel to “stop,” because it was “dangerous,” he heard himself say in a gravely serious, faintly humorous voice of uncertainly suppressed fear, but was distracted by how most of his thoughts were based on a reality in which he had fallen off the building. Should he close his eyes? What should he try to see? What would his mother do/feel? Could he grab things to disrupt his fall like in movies? Could one of these be his final thought? What would that mean? Why couldn’t he comprehend this? Should he think other things?[ERIN AND BURGERS] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: ERIN AND BURGERS",
    "text": "D: ERIN AND BURGERS Thursday, November 22, 2018 ERIN AND BURGERS Eight people were in Erin’s five-seat car, which had gotten lost on its way from Paul’s book-release reading in Brooklyn to DuMont Burger, also in Brooklyn, when it was stopped by a police car, in Manhattan, around two hundred feet from the Williamsburg Bridge. The officer shined a flashlight through the driver’s window at the backseat without bending to see what was there, then asked Erin, 24, who had driven four hours that day from Baltimore to attend Paul’s reading and visit friends, to step outside the car. Paul, in the front passenger seat, hadn’t seen Fran, who was sitting partly on him, or Daniel, in the backseat, in five or six weeks, except once, briefly and separately, at a Bret Easton Ellis reading three weeks ago, when they’d avoided each other, and Fran, without context, had shown Paul a text from Daniel insulting her in a strangely formal, almost aristocratic tone. Paul had communicated regularly, the past month, only with Charles, by email or Gmail chat, mostly about what food they had eaten, or were thinking about eating, to “console” themselves. After being more social, April to July, than any other period of his life, Paul had returned to his default lifestyle, which varied, to some degree, but generally entailed (1) avoiding most social situations (2) not wanting to sleep most nights and not knowing why—he’d wanted since 2006 to title one of his books I Don’t Want to Sleep but I Don’t Know What I’m Waiting For—resulting usually in four to ten hours of looking at the internet, reading, masturbating, etc. until morning, when he would eat something and sleep until night.Erin, back in her car, said the officer had looked at her two-months-expired, out-of-state driver’s license an abnormally long time, like he’d forgotten what he was doing, before quietly saying “be careful” and allowing her to continue driving, in what seemed to be an egregious oversight, without a ticket or decreasing passengers.Paul first learned of Erin twenty months ago, in January 2009, when she commented on his blog and he clicked her profile and read her pensive, melancholy, amusing accounts, on her blog, of her vague relationships and part-time bookstore job and nights drinking beer while looking at the internet and classes at the University of Baltimore, where she’d reenrolled after a two-year break. Paul found and read—and reread, with high levels of interest—three long stories, each focused on an unrequited or failed relationship, that she had published in online magazines. Erin, being an attractive and adventurous-seeming person, was probably almost always, Paul imagined, entering or leaving—or, in some way, maneuvering—one or more relationships, but probably, between relationships, as a person who seemed to enjoy being alone sometimes, would become more active on the internet, for weeks or months, which over months and years would overlap with Paul’s nearly continuously high levels of internet activity. They would gradually communicate more and maybe begin emailing and—if neither died, entered long relationships, or left the internet—eventually meet in person. Paul viewed this process as self-fulfilling, not something he wanted to track or manipulate, so after one or two weeks had mostly internalized Erin’s existence—as a busy person with a separate life, in a different city—and had stopped thinking about her by mid-February, when he met Michelle, with whom he was in a relationship both times, before tonight, that he met Erin in person.The first time was in July, when Erin visited New York City for the release of Charles’ poetry book. The day after the release Paul was amused and excited for them, at a BBQ, when Charles said he had kissed Erin.The second time was in September, one year ago, when Erin attended Paul’s reading in Baltimore. At a restaurant, with a large group of people, but talking only to each other, Paul asked about Charles, whom Erin had visited in August. Erin said she had changed her plane ticket and left earlier than planned because Charles had become gradually less affectionate, culminating with a night when, after sex, he said he didn’t feel anything for her, then consoled her, as she cried, in his kitchen. Paul liked Erin’s forthright, unhesitant, nonjudgmental answers and that she was able—already, despite what seemed like strong disappointment—to view and describe what had happened as at least partly amusing.  When Erin asked about Michelle, as they walked to her car, Paul automatically said Michelle was “good” while distinctly recalling a recent night when he complained he always offered her food or drink before himself, then after Michelle said she’d be happy to do that, now that she knew it mattered to him, said it didn’t matter to him and she shouldn’t change. Exiting Erin’s car, at the hotel he was staying in for one night, because a mysterious Johns Hopkins professor, whose Facebook name was “Cloud Bat,” had bought him a room, Paul thought that if he weren’t in a relationship with Michelle he would ask Erin upstairs, where they would, he vaguely imagined, continue talking.As Erin’s car slowly accelerated away from the police car, onto the Williamsburg Bridge, one person, then another, said they were illegally carrying drugs. After a peculiarly awkward, car-wide silence that became comical when someone asked if every person in the car was illegally carrying drugs, eliciting three affirmations and a sort of confirmatory announcement that every person—Erin, Paul, Daniel, Fran, Mitch, Juan, Jeannie, Jeremy—was illegally carrying drugs, there was the immediately space-filling noise of a small crowd laughing, which continued for around five seconds, during which Paul (who, in sharing his seat with Fran, was partly turned toward the driver’s window) watched the police car, or a police car, zoom past in the left lane, with emergency lights on and sirens off, quick and soundless as an apparition or the hologram of itself.In DuMont Burger’s bathroom Paul swallowed half of half a 30mg Oxycodone and .5mg Xanax, feebly amused to be already deviating, in moderate excess, from his plans to ingest specific amounts of drugs at certain times during his book tour, September 7 to November 4. To determine what amount of what drugs—MDMA, LSD, any benzodiazepine, amphetamine, opiate—he should ingest, on what days, to minimize anxiety and boredom for himself and others, he’d edited the seven-page itinerary from his publisher to fit on one page and, in an idle process he’d enjoyed, the past few weeks, studied each event in context, writing notes on the paper. He’d printed a final draft, currently in his pocket, that said he should ingest something—specified, in most instances, by type and amount—before twenty-two of his twenty-five events and some miscellaneous things such as the day a writer from BlackBook was writing an article about “hanging out” with him while doing that.Paul splashed water on his face, which he dried, then returned to his seat, next to Juan, who was talking to Jeremy about whether a horse could win “best athlete of the year.” Erin, the only person Paul felt like talking to, at the moment, was out of range, so when two acquaintances who didn’t know anyone else arrived Paul sat with them at a four-person table, where he felt self-conscious about the tenuousness of his situation—he hadn’t ordered food because he was nauseated from the Oxycodone and long car ride and he didn’t have anything he wanted to say to anyone. When a friend of the acquaintances arrived, sitting at the table’s fourth seat, Paul fixated on her—maybe partly to justify his increasingly pointless, idle presence—in an exaggerated manner (asking her questions continuously while sustaining a “concentrating expression” with such intensity, muddled by the onset of the drugs he’d used in the bathroom, that he sometimes felt able to sense the weight of the microscopic painting of the restaurant’s interior, decreased by a dimension and scaled down to almost nothing, resting on the top curvature of his right eyeball) that felt conducive to abruptly stopping and leaving,  which he did, after around fifteen minutes of increasingly forced conversation, walking six blocks to his room. <DMZ DREAM PACKET 5> [UCLA] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: UCLA",
    "text": "D: UCLA Thursday, November 22, 2018 UCLA Around two weeks later, he stayed for eight days in San Francisco in his own room, on the second floor of a house, which Daniel’s ex-girlfriend and exgirlfriend’s sister shared. An employee at Twitter invited him to its headquarters, where he ate from two different buffets. Daniel’s ex-girlfriend’s sister’s boyfriend sold him MDMA and mushrooms, which he ate a medium-large dose of before his reading at the Booksmith, which was livestreamed on the internet. His publisher left him a voice mail the next afternoon, asking him to call them to discuss “some problems.” He emailed them late that night apologizing for missing their call and said he was available by email. He met someone from Facebook and ingested LSD, which she declined, before watching Dave Eggers interview Judd Apatow for almost two hours in an auditorium. On her full-size mattress, three hours after the interview, they watched a forty-minute DVD of a Rube Goldberg machine and kissed a few minutes, then Paul “fingered” her and, after seeming to orgasm, she rolled over and slept.• • •In Los Angeles, the night before a panel discussion at UCLA on the topic of hipsters, after privately ingesting a little LSD, half a capsule of MDMA, a Ritalin—the combination of which, at Paul’s tolerance levels, had the effect of slightly distorting and energizing his base feeling of depression, so that he also felt many of its related emotions, such as despair and aggravation—he was designated, for some reason, to drive an NPR contributor’s car to a house party on the steepest street he had ever seen in person. After the house party, in a bar staffed by Asians, with Chinese and Vietnamese food, Paul saw and approached Taryn, who seemed happy to see him, to his mild surprise (they’d only met once and  vaguely, at the party where Paul put on “Today” by the Smashing Pumpkins). Taryn and a younger, sibling-like man, who at times seemed to be her boyfriend, but remained at a distance most of the night, went with Paul and the moderator of the next day’s panel discussion and other people to an apartment whose only purpose, someone kept saying, was for partying in when bars had closed. Paul felt the same mysterious, vague attraction to Taryn he felt in Brooklyn but unlike then, when they’d spoken probably three sentences to each other, they talked continuously, energetically. Taryn said she moved here a month ago after securing a full-time job as a copywriter for a fashion website, where her coworkers did, or did not—Paul became confused which, at some point, after realizing he’d laughed at both—know she had an MFA in poetry. Paul gradually remembered Taryn was friends with Caroline, that she and Caroline—and many of Paul’s acquaintances, including Shawn Olive, in Brooklyn—had been in the same one to three graduating classes for their MFAs in poetry at the New School and that most, or all, of them, as part of their curriculum, had read Paul’s first poetry book that he wrote the summer after graduating, in 2005, with a BA in journalism. The moderator of the next day’s panel discussion approached Paul and Taryn and said he had bought cocaine for them from a former Olympic soccer player whose father, before recently dying, had operated a major drug cartel. Paul and Taryn were led to a dresser, scattered on which were playing cards. The former Olympic soccer player indicated a six of spades, beneath which was twenty dollars’ worth of cocaine.• • •On UCLA’s campus the next night Paul photographed a piece of computer paper, taped crudely to a column, that said HIPSTER PANEL with an arrow pointing literally at the sky. In emails with the moderator of the panel discussion the past few weeks Paul had repeatedly half joked that he was going to “dominate the panel” and now, backstage peaking on one and a half capsules of MDMA and two Ritalin and an energy drink, he began openly conveying the same message to the other seven panelists, including a cofounder of Vice, the only person getting paid, everyone seemed to know, who was shirtless with 20oz beer and reacted to Paul’s robot-like extroversion with what seemed like barely suppressed confusion, which Paul tried to resolve by overpowering any possible awkwardness with his temporary charisma, which resulted in what seemed to be intimidation but was maybe an intimidation-based attempt at a non-antagonistic guardianship, which caused Paul, who felt he solely wanted to interact with mutual sincerity, to hesitate a little, which maybe the cofounder of Vice sensed as anxiety because he slapped Paul’s shoulder three times painfully. In his state of medium euphoria, with intensely dull eyes and an overall cyborg-like demeanor, Paul stared briefly at the cofounder of Vice before turning around and moving away with an earnest, uncertain feeling of disappointment. Paul arguably dominated the panel in a private way by multitasking (1) earnestly speaking on the topic of hipsters with uncharacteristic willingness to engage a matter of semantics (2) photographing other panelists and the audience and recording two videos with his iPhone (3) tweeting three times (4) interrupting people two or three times to defend audience members from the cofounder of Vice’s fashion criticisms (5) sustaining text conversations with Mia, who around a year ago had messaged Paul on Facebook, and Taryn, both of whom were alone in the audience of three to four hundred students and twenty to forty journalists (6) being asked the most questions during the Q&A, though almost all were negative and partially rhetorical,  including why he kept writing after the “excrement” that was his previous book.After the Q&A, during which Taryn had left due to a prior obligation, Paul talked a few minutes to Mia, vaguely remembering that she had lived, or something, in Crispin Glover’s “castle,” and wanted to spend more time with her, or Taryn, or the moderator, or the other panelists, at whatever post-panel party was probably beginning, but was driven in a sort of rush to the airport by two UCLA students, who in the front seats, talking to each other in voices Paul couldn’t hear, for some reason, maybe because a window was open, seemed far away and illusory. At the airport Paul saw he had another voice mail from his publisher and felt dread, then realized he was accidentally listening to it and that it was over—a six-second message asking Paul to “please” call them. Paul rested his head on his dining tray, mostly facedown and awake, during the flight to Minnesota, where after six hours of a seven-hour layover, a few minutes after putting his things in his backpack and standing to wait to get on a plane, he got a long email from his mother, saying she knew she had promised she wouldn’t anymore, but felt that she must, as a parent, continue telling Paul that she disapproved of his drug use. Paul could feel his intensely aggravated expression as he typed around three thousand words of stream-of-consciousness information about drugs and why the only way his mother could influence him to use less would be if she didn’t view them as good or bad, but learned about them, as a friend instead of a parent, because he was 27, all of which he’d stated, he knew, clearer and more convincingly, in dozens of emails the past four months to seemingly no lasting effect. His mother replied in a manner like his email—the longest he’d sent from an iPhone—had no effect on her and he replied again, expressing futility, then flew to Philadelphia, where after a bleakly sober reading in a tiny bookstore, which sold only used and rare books, he slept on a mostly empty bus, dropping him off in Brooklyn’s Chinatown, a place he’d forgotten existed. <DMZ DREAM PACKET 6> [CANADA] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: CANADA",
    "text": "D: CANADA Thursday, November 22, 2018 CANADA In Montreal, three days later, beneath a uniformly cloudy expanse, which glowed with the same intensity and asbestos-y texture everywhere, seeming less like a sky than the cloud-colored surface of a cold, hollowed-out sun, close enough to obstruct its own curvature, Paul walked slowly and aimlessly, sometimes standing in place, like an arctic explorer, noticing almost no other people and that something, on a general level, seemed familiar. He drank coffee and looked at the internet in a café, feeling gloomy and vertiginous when, after three hours, he went outside, where it had gotten significantly colder, to walk to a juice bar, twelve blocks away,  near the café where the world’s largest French-language radio station was interviewing him in an hour.The sky darkened and was now almost cloudless, like it had been gently suctioned from an interplanetary pressure system. As a red truck, clean and bright as a toy, passed on the street, Paul realized Montreal, with its narrower streets and cute beverage sizes and smaller vehicles, reminded him of Berlin. He’d gone alone to Berlin early in his relationship with Michelle for the German edition of his first novel—a year and a half ago, in March 2009, he calculated after two to three minutes of focused effort containing two long pauses without thoughts, but it felt more than five years away, like part of himself, while in Berlin, had gotten lost on its way here, taking more than five years instead of one and a half, a feeling that confused Paul, who stopped thinking, then realized he hadn’t thought about Taryn, or maybe any person, today and that he had no romantic prospects. He visualized the black dot of the top of his head—from an aerial view of two blocks—slowing to a standstill and remaining motionless on the sidewalk as other dots passed in either direction and the darkening city gradually brightened with artificial lights, the movie of his life finally ending, the credits scrolling down the screen.Shivering, he walked with increasing speed toward the juice bar, wanting to stop moving in a way that he’d disappear, which didn’t seem possible. He ingested two capsules of MDMA with a green smoothie, then walked four blocks to a café where he was interviewed by a small, balding, frequently laughing man of indiscernible age for around forty-five minutes, during which Paul smiled uncontrollably, with almost continuously unfocused eyes, unable to discern stillness in the single image of everything, containing him in a sphere of blurrily passing scenery. He felt low in his seat, warming  his hands on a cup of tea, and was sometimes aware that his face was arbitrarily pointing in strange directions, as if to consider his thoughts, or the interviewer’s questions, from various perspectives, probably seeming genuinely eccentric or weirdly, insanely pretentious. His teeth chattered and his upper body sometimes “convulsed,” he thought with brief interest, on the walk to the Drawn & Quarterly bookstore, where he sat absently in the audience in the back row with a slouched posture and, with a sensation of entering his body in medias res, at a moment when a decision, approved without his input, was about to actualize, said “is David Foster Wallace really big in America?” at a speaking volume to no one, it seemed.Five or six people, ahead of him, facing the stage, which he also faced, shifted a little in their seats but didn’t turn around. Paul realized he’d said “America” not “Canada” and, in his state of near immunity from shame and/or anxiety, acknowledged a theoretical embarrassment, which someone not on MDMA, in his situation, might experience. For one or two seconds, with tepid disappointment toward himself, before moving nearer to the stage, Paul dimly believed people had ignored him because they knew he was on drugs and were afraid he might say more things that would humiliate and further expose himself, in a completely non-funny way, as pathetic and troubling and drug-addled and sad. After the reading, then a Q&A—during which someone asked if Paul felt like his life had changed the past few years and he said no, which he qualified by saying it had, then after a pause said he honestly felt unable to answer accurately—the owner of Drawn & Quarterly approached and thanked Paul for coming to Montreal. Paul pitched a children’s book, to be illustrated by a known graphic novelist who’d confirmed interest, based on one of his poems—when i was five i wentfishing with my familywhen i was fivei went fishing with my familymy dad caught a turtlemy mom caught a snappermy brother caught a crabi caught a whalethat night we ate crabthe next night we ate turtlethe next night we ate snapperthe next night we ate whalethe next night we ate whalethe next night we ate whalethe next night we ate whalethe next night we ate whalethe next night we ate whale—with each line on its own page and the last line repeated as many times as needed. Maybe a different artist could illustrate each page to create a sort of anthology. As a children’s book, due to the content, it would appeal to college students and teenagers and be a popular gift choice. It could become “one of those things,” said Paul, who considered, at one point, while talking, if his behavior might be a little tactless and easily concluded it might be to “normal people” but not the owner of Drawn & Quarterly, which had published many books, among Paul’s favorites, sympathetic to socially dysfunctional characters.When Paul finished talking, the owner, who’d sustained a polite, slightly tense smile and a tired and unblinking gaze, said “thank you” and walked away.Paul’s main feeling, an hour and a half later, in a café with six to eight strangers, staring at his hands wrapped tightly around his teacup, was an excruciating combination of social anxiety and, as the MDMA stopped working, disintegrating functioning, including tremulous fingers and what felt like an inability to control or predict the volume and pitch of his voice and a helpless sensation that his face—especially if he tried to mollify its severe appearance, which he would need to do if anyone asked him a question—might begin quivering or flinching uncontrollably. His memory of what he now viewed as a “major, egregious faux pas,” his interaction with Drawn & Quarterly’s owner, was vague and nonlinear and dominated by a troubling suspicion that, with his pitch of a book in a genre Drawn & Quarterly didn’t publish, he’d interrupted the owner’s initial greeting.Hiding in the bathroom, Paul remembered that, when he processed the identity of the owner, approaching from maybe six feet away, he’d felt a sensation not unlike clicking “send” for a finished draft of a long email, setting off his children’s book pitch. He probably had referenced his poem as if it were common knowledge because he didn’t know how he could have conveyed its effect without reciting it in full. He remembered, or thought he remembered, seeing disappointment inside the owner’s eyes—a faint off-coloring, like  a woundless scar, a millimeter behind the cornea—which had seemed sad in a manner like his life (operating his publishing company, living in the same apartment for twenty years, accumulating obligations in the bleak world of graphic novels) was a pure, omnipresent, concrete reminder, Paul vaguely imagined while standing in a stall staring at his iPhone, that he was the only entity building and embellishing and imperialistically expanding his own unhappiness.Paul arrived in Toronto the next night on a Megabus, then rode two city buses to the apartment of a Type Books employee and his girlfriend and slept on a sofa. In Whole Foods the next day, for around five hours, he ate watermelon and looked at the internet and typed answers to an email interview. He walked to a café near Type Books and asked on one of the two threads on 4chan about him that, for some reason, had appeared the last two days—and, with two to four hundred posts each, 90 to 95 percent derogatory, were the two longest threads on him that he’d ever seen—if anyone in Toronto could sell him MDMA or mushrooms within two hours. Someone named Rodrigo, who’d recently moved here from San Francisco, Paul discerned via Facebook, emailed that he could get mushrooms and maybe MDMA but not until after Paul’s reading.In Type Books people stood in an encroaching half  circle around a nervously grinning Paul, seated on a stool, “completely exposed,” he felt, as an employee read a long, admiring, complicated introduction that seemed like it had incorporated sections of a dissertation. Paul, appearing sometimes openly frightened, honestly answered “I don’t know” for almost every question during the Q&A, then in each ensuing silence, feeling pressure to elaborate, mumbled sentence fragments he knew were untrue or inaccurate before, in closing, reiterating “I don’t know.” Near the end, while saying “but I don’t really know,” he stuttered a little. After the reading he went to a restaurant with four Type Books employees and their friend Alethia, 22, who had published around six hundred articles since leaving college two years ago to write for Toronto’s leading alt weekly. Paul asked if Alethia, whom he felt attracted to and curious about, wanted to interview him while, as a journalistic angle, he was “on MDMA.”In Rodrigo’s apartment, a few hours later, Paul searched his name in Alethia’s email account—signed in on Rodrigo’s tiny, malformed-looking, non-MacBook laptop—while she was in the bathroom and saw she had pitched an article on him, two months ago, to the Toronto Sun, who had not responded, it seemed. Paul and Rodrigo each swallowed a capsule of MDMA. Paul said he felt “nothing” and swallowed another and, when it began taking effect, repeatedly encouraged Alethia to also ingest MDMA, “for the interview,” but she declined, citing that when she tried LSD she rode a bus around Toronto for five hours. Rodrigo lay with his girlfriend on his bed as Paul and Alethia sat on beanbags on the floor and talked for two and a half hours, during which Paul sometimes wanted to hug or kiss Alethia, whose default expression, it seemed, was “worried,” sometimes in an endearingly doe-like manner and sometimes like it was an effect of her job, as a full-time journalist, with its deadlines and copyediting, Paul thought half sarcastically more than once. Alethia said “you were saying you’ve been doing readings on drugs because it makes you feel more comfortable” and asked why.“Um, actually, I just think it’s more fun.”“More fun for you, or the people who are there?”“In my view it’s more fun for everyone,” said Paul.“So when you did that reading a few weeks ago on mushrooms . . . you stopped after two minutes?”“Um,” said Paul. “Two minutes?”“Yeah. Is that what happened?”“What reading?”“Oh. I don’t know . . . a few weeks ago.”“The Booksmith?”“Yeah. In San Francisco.”“Oh. I was seeing ‘tribal patterns’ on the paper, because I was staring at it on mushrooms, and I felt like I was sweating, and I kept thinking ‘Hunter S. Thompson.’ Then I felt like I couldn’t go on anymore. I was preparing to say something like ‘I’m having a bad drug experience, I need to go home.’ But I looked up, at the people, and regained control.”An hour later they were discussing a recent trend of Megabus accidents, described by Paul, who was riding a Megabus to Manhattan tomorrow, as “like, twenty people dying five times in the last few days,” when Alethia asked if Paul was worried he’d be “the next to die.”“No. I don’t care if I die.”“Um,” said Alethia laughing.“I feel like I honestly don’t care if I die.”“Really? You’re not worried about dying?”“No, I think. I’m ready to die whenever.”“Because you’ve written enough books?”“No, no,” said Paul shaking his head a little. “I don’t know. I’m just ready to die. Life just seems like . . . it’s fine if I die.  Once I’m dead I’m dead.” Rodrigo from his bed said “but in an interview you talk about eating healthy and not smoking because you’ll be more productive.” Paul said health and drugs and being productive were all in service of feeling good. Alethia said she took Ritalin almost every day, from ages 8 to 12, for “attention deficit disorder.” Paul said “that seems horrible” and “that must’ve changed you.”“Yeah, I think it did,” said Alethia. “I think it did.”“People who take the most drugs by far are the kids—”“It’s so true,” said Alethia.“—who get prescribed them,” said Paul.“Who’s, like, your closest friend?”“I just felt, like . . . really alone when you said that.”“Oh no! I’m sorry.”“Wait, there has to be someone,” said Paul grinning. “I feel like I have close friends but we stop talking. Right now, I guess, what person do I feel closest to?”“Yeah,” said Alethia.“Um, I can’t remember right now. I feel close to different people over sets of days. Like if I’ve been texting someone, but then I’ll forget about them.”“Do you sometimes feel like it sucks—to just, like, live in the world?”“What do you mean?” said Paul slowly.“Like, that the world can’t provide us with enough to satisfy us.”“No,” said Paul after around ten seconds, and covered his face with his hands. “I mean . . . the world is good enough, based on evidence, because I haven’t killed myself. Like, if I killed myself . . . I could say the world is bad, on average.”“Like definitively,” said Alethia.“On average,” said Paul through his hands. “Since the urge to kill myself isn’t so strong that I actually kill myself, the world is worth living in.”• • •Alethia left around 4:30 a.m., easily declining Paul’s suggestions, bordering on “pleas,” he felt, that she stay. Rodrigo and his girlfriend seemed asleep. Sitting on a sofa, in the common room, Paul texted Alethia: “This is Paul. Good night, glad we met.” Alethia responded: “Me too. You are wonderful.” Paul lay on the sofa, bristling with wakefulness, for around forty minutes, then put his MacBook in his backpack and wrote a two-sentence note to Rodrigo and walked outside into a silvery, wintry light.On a Megabus to New York City—for around fifteen hours, due to a two-hour delay in Buffalo—he read all he could find by Alethia on the internet, becoming more “obsessed,” he felt, after each article, lying on his back across two seats with knees bent, twice dropping his iPhone onto his face. His interest in Alethia naturally decreased, the next few days, then they texted a few times and he felt renewed obsession, but he didn’t like her impersonal tone in their emails discussing their interview—which she’d spent eight hours transcribing—and, less than a week after they met, all he felt toward her, to his weak amusement, was an unexamined combination of indifference and vague resentment, which he described in an email to Charles, whose previous knowledge of Alethia was that Paul liked her “a lot,” as “strong aversion,” only half joking. Paul’s next email to Charles said “I feel like I ‘hate’ her” and that it seemed, by the bureaucratic language and curtness of Alethia’s emails, like she also “hated” him, that they “hated” each other.<DMZ DREAM PACKET 7> [SHOPLIFTING FROM AMERICAN APPAREL] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: SHOPLIFTING FROM AMERICAN APPAREL",
    "text": "D: SHOPLIFTING FROM AMERICAN APPAREL Thursday, November 22, 2018 SHOPLIFTING FROM AMERICAN APPAREL A few days later Paul was walking to the library holding a large iced coffee. He had a reading in Manhattan in a few hours. He thought about the shirt he was wearing. He walked into American Apparel. He looked at things and sometimes touched things. He saw a person holding a book two inches from his face with his eyes over the top of the book. Paul thought the person was behaving strangely. A few minutes later Paul walked out of American Apparel holding an American Apparel shirt.The person with the book made noises behind Paul on the sidewalk. “Do you work there?” said Paul. The person said he did. “Do you really work for American Apparel?” said Paul. The person displayed a police badge attached to his belt buckle beneath his oversized jersey. “Oh,” said Paul.They went inside. They went downstairs. Paul was photographed and put in handcuffs. “Don’t steal from us,” said a manager looking at a computer screen. “Steal from some shitty corporation. We have fair-trade labor. I mean fair labor.”“I spend my money on even better places,” said Paul. “Organic vegan restaurants.”“I’m all for that,” said the manager.Someone wrote “arrested” on Paul’s photo and put it on the wall with about thirty other photos. The person who caught Paul put his head next to Paul’s head and another photo was taken. “What are you trying to do, Luigi?” someone said. “Get a bonus?”Two people behind Paul whispered things to each other.A few seconds later someone took the handcuffs off Paul.About fifteen minutes later two policemen arrived and put different handcuffs on Paul and walked him outside into a police car.At the police station Paul was put in a cell with a bald Caucasian, a skinny Hispanic, and a tall Asian. Paul sat on a concrete bench. The tall Asian said he bought things from Duane Reade and went to Kmart and on the way out a security person stopped him and looked in his tote bag and saw shampoo and toothpaste from Duane Reade and said he stole those things from Kmart and brought him into a room and told him to get into a cell. The tall Asian refused and the security person put him in a headlock and punched him and kicked him and emptied his tote bag and took his money.The tall Asian made a motion of putting bills of cash into his chest pocket. Paul laughed then had a neutral facial expression. The tall Asian said Kmart was “running a racket.” He said he didn’t have money for a lawyer. He said he was an international student from Canada.“Canada,” said Paul.A drunk man with blood inside his ears and on his face and shirt was put in the cell. Paul saw that the man looked like the Caucasian boxer in Rocky V that is trained by Rocky and then betrays Rocky. “I get punched in the face at Starbucks and I get thrown in jail?” screamed the drunk man. “You motherfuckers. I hope you motherfuckers are really enjoying your jobs. Fingerprinting people like me while fucking national security … matters of national security and fucking terrorists … this isn’t fair. You motherfuckers.” He sat on the bench. He stood and said “All right, I am the king of this cell. Everyone sit down. I am the king of this cell.” He touched the skinny Hispanic.“Hey man, don’t touch me,” said the skinny Hispanic. “I don’t do nothing to you. I didn’t do nothing to you, don’t touch me.” The drunk man looked at the skinny Hispanic. They shook hands. “Solidarity,” thought Paul. “I’m covered in blood and I’m in jail,” screamed the drunk man. “This isn’t fair. I am going to ass-rape you so hard.”A policeman outside the cell said the drunk man would be ass-raped first and left the room.“You don’t want to fuck with a man who is smarter than Einstein,” screamed the drunk man.A policewoman told the drunk man to stop acting like an asshole.“I get beat up in a bar and this is what I get,” screamed the drunk man. “You motherpuggers, motherfuckers. I am so angry right now. I have so much respect for the armed forces. I respect you. You are the NYPD. That is awesome. With all due respect fuck you. You fuckers. Look at me. My shirt is covered in blood and I’m in jail.” The drunk man walked into Paul sitting on the floor against a wall. The drunk man looked at Paul then screamed “Where is the other guy?” at a policeman outside the cell. “Is he here now? Just answer my question. Where is the other guy? Is he here?” The policeman said the other guy wasn’t here. “Awesome,” screamed the drunk man. “Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.”“What’s your name?” said the tall Asian to the drunk man.“Arthur,” said the drunk man. “I took the intelligence test and I got a fucking 1520. 1580. I blew the lid off that test. Plus I’m big.” The tall Asian asked the drunk man about being punched in Starbucks. “I got in a bar fight,” said the drunk man. “I take some clients out and this is what I get.” The tall Asian asked what happened to the other guy. “He ran away,” said the drunk man.It was quiet in the cell for a few minutes.“I am going to kill everyone here,” said the drunk man. “Is everyone okay with that? Is everyone in this cell okay with that? Let’s get our word on that, okay? Raise your hand if you’re okay with this.” He touched the skinny Hispanic and the skinny Hispanic stood with an angry facial expression and said “Don’t hit me. Don’t hit me.” The bald Caucasian stood in front of the drunk man with an angry facial expression. The police took the drunk man out of the cell. “You are never working in the union again,” screamed the drunk man at the bald Caucasian.“Union?” said the bald Caucasian laughing. “What the fuck are you talking about? I’m a drug dealer about to go away for a long time.”The police held the drunk man as he screamed obscenities.“Where’s your union now, bitch?” said the bald Caucasian.The police put the drunk man in a different cell. “I get in a stupid bar fight and I’m covered in blood,” he screamed out of view. “And I’m the one in jail. What about the other guy?”“I thought you were in Starbucks,” said a policeman.“I was taking a shit in Starbucks, and I come out, and some guy hits me,” said the drunk man. “I was in Starbucks,” he screamed. “You don’t believe me? I was in fucking McSorley’s … the oldest bar … you motherfuckers. This isn’t fair.”“Life isn’t fair,” said an African American policeman.“You,” screamed the drunk man loudly. “Life. You. You are bringing life into this? Don’t do that you motherfucker. Don’t fucking do that. You are bringing life into this. I can’t believe you are doing this to me. I am so angry right now. I need to make some phone calls. I am running a failing business. I need to check my email.” The drunk man called the African American policeman a nigger then said “You fat Irish boy who couldn’t get a girlfriend so you became a cop, fuck you” to another policeman. The bald Caucasian shouted “You rich whiny-ass white boy” and something about the drunk man’s expensive watch. “My watch,” screamed the drunk man. “Don’t talk about my fucking watch you motherfucker. I am going to have sex with your little sister so hard. My watch. I have a fucking twenty-thousand-dollar Rolex you motherfucker. I don’t wear it out. It’s more expensive than … I am going to fucking sue all of you.”“That’s what I’m talking about,” said the bald Caucasian. “Rich white boy. That’s what rich white boys do, they say they’re going to sue you.”“Shut up,” screamed the drunk man. “I’m trying to take a nap.”“When this first happened I was kind of angry,” said the tall Asian. “Now I feel better. I don’t know anyone this has happened to, you know, it’s an experience.”A policeman took the bald Caucasian out to get his fingerprints on a machine outside the two cells. The skinny Hispanic stood and said he was in for possession of two ounces of marijuana. He said he had another bag of marijuana and pointed at his crotch and grinned. He touched his shoe and said there were pills inside. He said something about making $1,000 at Central Booking. The bald Caucasian came back and said the Fukanese ran Chinatown now. He said he sold fireworks since he was eleven. He said everyone used to eat well in Chinatown. Then the Fukanese took over and fucked everything up. He asked Paul what part of China he was from. Paul said he was from Taiwan.“You know that little island off China?” said Paul.“I know,” said the bald Caucasian. “I am geographically sound.”A policeman said the drunk man had beaten up a homeless person in Tompkins Square Park, not gotten beat up at Starbucks. The drunk man was snoring in the other cell. The bald Caucasian and the skinny Hispanic talked about hurting the drunk man. They discussed the placement of surveillance cameras at Central Booking. “He’s drunk, people are different when they’re drunk,” said the African American policeman in a shy voice. “He might sober up and be the nicest person you ever met.”The “fat Irish boy” policeman woke the drunk man to get his fingerprints. It took about ten minutes to get the drunk man’s fingerprints. The drunk man and the policeman hugged. The tall Asian was released. The bald Caucasian went in a side room with a policeman. “They told me what I was getting,” he said back in the cell. “I’m going away for a long time.” He talked about killing the drunk man. A policeman gave Paul his belt and shoelaces. Paul signed a paper saying he would go to court. He walked to American Apparel. Luigi was on the sidewalk. Luigi grinned at Paul and went inside and got Paul’s duffel bag.“Thank you for shopping at American Apparel,” said Luigi.“You’re welcome,” said Paul. “Thank you for being nice to me. Good night.”At the library Paul emailed the organizer of the reading he was scheduled for that night, CC-ing the other reader. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there today,” said the email. “I was arrested earlier and got out around 9:30 in Manhattan somewhere. Was it okay without me? Very sorry about this.”The other reader replied asking if Paul wanted a free copy of his book.Paul emailed the person his address and went outside. He bought an iced coffee and went back in the library, where he swallowed a 2mg Xanax and read an account of his Montreal reading, when he was on two capsules of MDMA, describing him as “charismatic, articulate, and friendly.”He read an account of his Toronto reading, when he’d been sober, describing him as “monosyllabic,” “awkward,” “stilted and unfriendly” within a disapproval of his oeuvre, itself vaguely within a disapproval of contemporary culture and, by way of a link to someone else’s essay, the internet.[BALTIMORE] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: BALTIMORE",
    "text": "D: BALTIMORE Thursday, November 22, 2018 BALTIMORE At a flea market with Erin in Baltimore, where Paul gave the second-last reading of his tour, after drinking the equivalent of six to eight cups of coffee—in the form of 24x condensed coffee, which they bought from Whole Foods and had never seen before, in containers reminiscent of toilet-cleaning liquid—they pretended to be Wall Street Journal reporters and recorded themselves interviewing strangers about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Erin meekly asked a large, young, thuggish-looking man and his smaller friend, both wearing backward caps, if they thought Darth Vader would “die in this one.” After a long pause the large man laughed and said “man, I don’t know,” and looked at his friend, who appeared expressionless, like he hadn’t heard anything that had been said.“Darth Vader is Star Trek, not Harry Potter,” said Paul in a weak form of the “the voice,” feigning he was remembering this aloud.“No, no,” said Erin grinning. “Really?”“Star Wars,” said Paul laughing a little.“Oh, I don’t know, never mind, never mind, I need to check my notes,” said Erin shaking her head and grinning as she and Paul walked away mumbling to each other, attempting to parody, Paul felt, a stereotypical comedy in which two high-level professionals are egregiously demoted into positions where they struggle to regain their jobs while nurturing between them an unlikely romance and mutually learning the true meaning in life. Erin said she felt “a strong need to be on more drugs.” Without MDMA it was difficult to use “the voice,” without which they felt uncomfortable talking to strangers, improvising, feigning behavior, trying to be witty.• • •Around midnight, on the drive back to New York, Erin said her father seemed to enjoy giving her Xanax and Adderall and that she used to get angry at him for smoking marijuana every night because it affected his memory and he would repeat himself—and, if stopped, would become defensive, argumentative—but now she didn’t try to change him anymore. Paul said his father’s default name for him, what he’d unconsciously say to get Paul’s attention or to reference Paul in conversation, was “baby” until high school, or maybe college, when it became “old baby”—in Taiwanese, where both words were one syllable—which was what he now called almost all people and animals, including Dudu, the toy poodle, Paul remembered, that his parents had bought sometime in the past year.Paul talked about the panicked-seeming, alienating emails his mother had sent him the past few months, beginning in June—when he had published nonfiction on the internet mentioning cocaine and Adderall—and increasing during his book tour, when more information connecting him and drugs (tweets soliciting drugs, a “contest” on his blog to discern from the livestreamed video what drug he was on during his San Francisco reading, the interview with Alethia on MDMA) got on the internet. The emails had seemed complicatedly, strategically composed (referencing movies, news articles, celebrities who’ve “ruined their lives,” etc.) to instill mostly fear and shame and a little guilt to reduce Paul’s drug use, for the exclusive benefit, Paul believed his mother believed, of Paul’s long-term happiness, which however Paul had repeatedly defined as “freedom” to do what he wanted and “trust,” from his friends and family, that he was doing what, based on everything he knew, would result in the happiest results for everyone involved, which was what she also wanted, he’d told her many times. Paul had stated ultimatums like “if you mention drugs one more time I’m not responding to your emails for the rest of the month,” which his mother had repeatedly agreed on and went against, saying she felt an obligation—that it was her duty—as a parent, to continue stating her disapproval. To an increasingly frustrated and, he sometimes suspected of himself, paranoid and distrustful Paul, the emails had begun, at some point, to tactically operate on, at the least, a base of reverse-reverse psychology, which was a cause of despair for Paul, who throughout had tried to stress—but seemed to have failed to convincingly convey—that their relationship would only worsen if they couldn’t communicate directly, without strategy or hyperbole or deception, while aware of himself often not communicating directly.The emails during the book tour culminated maybe with a series of emails sent after Paul and Erin posted their “event coverage” of Caked Up! —an event where cakes made by graphic designers, including Paul’s brother, were served buffet style—where they’d pretended to be from jezebel.com and an uninhibited Paul, on MDMA, had loudly shouted at strangers, at one point, at a volume and with an amount of belligerence that was normal for most people but, for him, was done, he’d felt, for comic effect. Paul’s mother had emailed saying that the Paul in the video was not the Paul she knew and loved and that she was scared and, seeing what Paul “had turned into,” had cried. Paul stopped responding to her emails at that point, and, at the moment, in the car with Erin, couldn’t remember offhand what he’d last said to her—either that he wasn’t responding to her emails until January, wasn’t responding to any emails mentioning drugs, or wasn’t responding until he believed she had internalized that their relationship would only deteriorate, causing them both to feel worse about everything and probably increase his drug use, if she continued mentioning drugs with intent to influence instead of learn or discuss, as friends, by asking questions. Paul vaguely remembered two or three emails asking when he was coming to Taiwan this year; he’d responded he didn’t want to due to all the emails and broken promises, she replied, again, that she was sorry and would send no more emails mentioning drugs, and that Paul's father and her were considering moving back to their home in Orlando next year, for a few months, and suggested Paul visit them when they did. Paul believed he was doing what was best for them both and that his mother believed she was doing what was best for only Paul and not herself. Paul didn’t want his mother to believe she had failed, as a parent, which he thought she must, on some level, if she was trying to change what she had created and raised, though maybe she was only focused on the task, not on her feelings.<DMZ DREAM PACKET 8>[DOPE] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: DOPE",
    "text": "D: DOPE Thursday, November 22, 2018 DOPE A few weeks later, in heavy snowfall, which briefly caused him to wonder what month he was in, Paul was standing outside Bobst Library waiting for Peanut—to buy drugs for the next three days, when he and Erin would be in Pittsburgh for a reading—when he received a call from his publisher saying that the organizer of his Pittsburgh reading had canceled, and something implying that this was due to his recent “antics.”  Paul saw Juan walking past and asked what he was doing. Juan said he was buying a Clif Bar and going to the gym and asked what Paul was doing.“I’m meeting someone to buy drugs.”“What drugs are you buying?”Peanut was approaching on the sidewalk.“I’ll tell you after, he’s there, he probably won’t want to see you,” said Paul remembering once when he and Erin got in Peanut’s car and Peanut became very still a few seconds before quietly saying “yo,” and that he’d expected one person.“I didn’t know you was a writer,” said Peanut.“Yeah,” said Paul.“What books you’ve written?”“Like five books,” said Paul.“A book’s a book,” said Peanut, and Paul got in his car. The middle-aged woman in the driver’s seat was wearing a baseball cap. Paul wasn’t sure if she’d worn it every other time or no other time. Paul asked if Peanut had mushrooms. “No,” said Peanut. “But I’m working on that for you.”“What else do you have on you?”“On me? I’ve got a bundle of dope.”Paul, walking toward Think Coffee, where Erin was working on writing, told Juan he bought Ketamine, MDMA, Xanax. Juan said when he tried Ketamine he felt like he could feel the solar system flying through space and that he had been on his bed and had pointed the top of his head in the same  direction. Paul said he also bought heroin and Juan said he knew people when he was in high school (in Kansas, where he had been arrested for selling marijuana, Paul uncertainly knew) who used heroin and one had died.“What do you mean?” said Paul vaguely.“I think he died,” said Juan, and they slowed to a kind of loitering, as a policeman, behind them, walked past. They stood in place, then continued walking.“When did they die?”“I’m not really sure,” said Juan.“He died,” said Paul grinning. “How?”“I don’t know.”“Why did he die?”“I don’t know. I just know he died.”Walking back with Erin to his apartment, Paul said in a quiet monotone that they should celebrate the end of his tour by overdosing on heroin. Erin suggested they invite Daniel and Fran, who might also be interested, she felt. They settled on snorting heroin in Paul’s room after dinner, then going to the Union Square theater to “group livetweet” whatever movie fit their schedule. They would sit separately during the movie and communicate only through tweets, in service of making the experience “more fun and interesting,” said Paul, who anticipated wanting to be alone in the theater.At Paul’s apartment Maggie volunteered to help Paul juice fennel, celery, cucumber, lemon while Erin showered and Calvin did something in Paul’s room. Paul organized three bags of heroin into four different-size piles—Fran only wanted a little—while Erin bought tickets for X-Men: First Class at 12:35 a.m. Paul drew lines connecting three names to three lines of heroin and heard Daniel say “I think I just figured out I can be happy no matter what people around me are doing” to what seemed to be himself and earnestly thought “funny” in a monotone with a neutral expression, then snorted his heroin and showered and ingested 15mg Adderall, two Advil, half a marijuana cookie. Paul vomited on the street twice before they got in a taxi with Erin in the front passenger seat and Fran in the backseat between Paul and Daniel, who was commenting on the taxi’s TV, which was talking about Shaquille O’Neal.“You should tweet it, stop talking about it,” said Paul, and opened his door at a red light to vomit, but didn’t and received from someone a plastic bag, which he vomited in twice with an overall sensation of disconcern-based serenity. He tweeted “in cab to theater, ‘already’ vomited twice (jk re seeming to imply xmen will make me vomit)” and read a tweet that said “put hand through cab glass to pet Paul as he vomited into a bag, cabdriver looked at me in a sitcom-like way” and said “Erin, you forgot the hashtag” while staring at his own tweet. “I forgot the hashtag also. We’re all just going to keep forgetting it. What’re we going to do?”“I recommend copy and pasting.” said Erin.“We’re all just going to keep forgetting it,” said Paul “pessimistically,” he thought, and when he exited the taxi he walked into, instead of onto, the sidewalk and fell stumbling ahead in an uninhibited, loosely controlled, briefly uncontrolled manner reminiscent of childhood, when this partial  to complete abandonment of body and/or limb (of rolling like a log on carpet, falling face-first onto beds, being dragged by an arm or both legs through houses or side yard, floating in swimming pools, lying upside down in headstands on sofas) was normal, allowing his unexpected momentum to naturally expend, falling horizontally for an amusingly far length. He imagined continuing forward in a pretending of momentum, transitioning into a jog, disappearing into the distance. He vomited on the street, then turned around and jogged to Fran, who stood motionless with a preoccupied expression.“I’m okay,” said Paul. “Where are they? Daniel, Erin.”“Buying water,” said Fran.“How do you feel?”“Floaty,” said Fran with a neutral expression. “Good. How do you feel?”“Good,” said Paul smiling. “I just used too much.”When they entered the theater the movie had already begun. Paul sat in a stadium-seated area, above and behind everyone else in the front area. After a few minutes he went to Fran, who was in an isolated seat, on the right side of the theater. Fran pointed at Erin and Daniel, twenty feet away, talking to each other.“We agreed to sit separately,” said Fran.“I want separately also,” said Paul.“I feel upset,” said Fran.“I’m going to see what’s happening,” said Paul, and crossed an aisle, past five empty seats, to Erin, as Daniel left the theater. Erin said Daniel had wanted to share her phone. Paul said Daniel “should just go charge it for like ten minutes.”“I know. That’s what I said. He’s doing that now.”“Daniel went to charge his phone,” said Paul to Fran, and returned to his seat. He tweeted “someone in my row is snoring #xmenlivetweet” and “kevin bacon had something like 10 hands #xmenlivetweet.” Fran tweeted she wanted more heroin. Paul tweeted “i can hear someone snoring ~8 seats to my left #xmenlivetweet” and saw Fran leave the theater and stared absently as Kevin Bacon talked to people. Kevin Bacon walked outside, where it was snowing, then he turned around and talked to the same people as before, who had followed him. Paul tried to remember why Kevin Bacon had gone outside. He read tweets from Fran that said “feeling lonely #xmenlivetweet” and “i am in the bathroom contemplating chugging my beer,” which had no hashtag. Paul saw that Erin had left the theater. Paul cautiously entered the women’s bathroom, a few minutes later, hearing Fran’s voice and movement noises from the handicapped stall.“Excuse me, ma’am,” said Paul in a loud, authoritative voice, and the movement noises stopped.“Yes?” said Erin after a pause.“It’s me,” said Paul.“Oh, shit,” said Fran, and the door opened.“I was scared,” said Erin, partly in view.“You’re in the women’s bathroom,” said Fran.“Sorry,” said Paul grinning, and left and sat on the carpeted floor near an emergency exit and tweeted “where is everyone . . . i’m sitting in darkness near the women’s bathroom #xmenlivetweet” and that he was going to try to scare Erin and Fran again. He read “just stood up, lost ‘all control’ of left leg and fell into an arcade game, making a loud noise and ‘yelping’ #xmenlivetweet” by Daniel. He read “someone just said ‘we did it!’ while seeming to float in an indoor ‘future area’ #xmenlivetweet” by Erin. He heard Fran’s voice and walked quickly to her and Erin and thrust his glass bottle of water at them but water didn’t leave the bottle until, as the bottle neared himself, some splashed onto his chin and neck. Daniel was sitting on the floor by the candy machines, smiling calmly at his phone. Erin gave Paul and Fran tea-tree toothpicks. Paul went in the theater to his seat and tweeted “why is ‘beast’ flying a jet plane . . . #xmenlivetweet” and “is this world war 2, i don’t understand anything #xmenlivetweet” and “i’m going to stand to look at who has been snoring loudly for ~15 min. #xmenlivetweet” and “someone seems to be laying across 2 seats sleeping #xmenlivetweet.” He became aware of the tea-tree toothpick’s wiggling, outside his mouth, and of his intensely concentrating expression, as he worked on editing a tweet, a few minutes after credits had begun scrolling down the screen, when the white shape, of Erin in a white dress, in Paul’s peripheral vision, stopped enlarging, indicating an arrival.On the train Paul asked if Erin felt okay and she said she did, and asked if Paul did. Fran jumped in front of them and posed with the sleeping, drooling, middle-aged man in an opposite seat. “I’m okay with everything,” said Paul distractedly, with some confusion, after moving his iPhone into position and photographing only the middle-aged man because Fran had returned to her seat.“Are you sure?” said Erin.“Yeah. I’m okay with everything if you are.”“I am,” said Erin.“I feel nauseated,” said Paul a few minutes later. “But I’m okay with everything. If I’m not talking it’s because I’m nauseated.”“Okay,” said Erin. “Thank you for telling me.”In the large deli below Harry’s apartment Paul walked away, at one point, from everyone else and, alone in an aisle, turned into a barrier-like display of heavily discounted tomato sauce. None fell, or seemed to have been disturbed, or affected, to any degree, and no one saw. After buying beer, fennel, celery, a plastic bag of apples, three lemons and walking six blocks Paul and Erin sat on a sidewalk waiting for Daniel and Fran to get their sleeping bags from where they’d been staying.“You’re really quiet suddenly,” said Erin.“I’m really nauseated,” said Paul, and rested the weight of his head facedown on his open palms, covering his eyes and cheeks and forehead. It began raining lightly, in a mist, as if onto produce, or probably an air conditioner was dripping condensation. Paul weakly tried to remember what month it was, stopping after a few seconds, and moved his shoulders to indicate he didn’t want to be touched when Erin began rubbing his back.Fran was in the bathroom and Paul was sitting cross-legged on his mattress, around half an hour later, absently reading descriptions of mutants on X-Men: First Class’s Wikipedia page—“scientist who is transformed into a frightening-looking mutant in an effort to cure himself, but is kind at heart”—when Daniel asked if “anyone” wanted to sit with him on the front stoop while he smoked.“Me. I will,” said Erin, who had been drying her hair with a towel after showering, and Paul saw her looking at herself in the wall mirror. He clicked “Kevin Bacon” and looked at the words “Kevin Bacon (disambiguation)” without thinking anything for a vague amount of time, until Fran entered the room, when he stood and went in the bathroom and heard Erin say “actually, I’ll have a beer” and Daniel say “really?” and “cool.”He entered his room wearing boxer shorts—Fran was sitting in a far corner looking at her MacBook with a serious expression—and turned around and put on a shirt, sat on his mattress, placed his MacBook on his lap, stared at the words “Bacon in 2007” with slightly unfocused eyes. Fran said she had a stomachache and moved onto the mattress asking if Paul wanted beer, which she held toward him and which he mutely held a few seconds before moving it near Fran, who drank some and put it on the floor and resettled herself on the mattress with the sides of their knees touching.“Daniel and Erin have been gone so long,” said Paul.“Maybe they’re watching the sunrise,” said Fran.“I don’t think you can see it from here.”“Maybe they went somewhere.”“I don’t think you can see it from anywhere near here.”“I don’t know where they are,” said Fran.“Do you feel depressed still?”“Yeah,” said Fran.“Because of you and Daniel?”“Yeah.”She said she felt depressed because she’d been really close with Daniel, so now something in her life felt missing. Paul asked about the singer, of a punk band he listened to often in high school, who had kissed Fran, she’d said in an email, in someone’s car after a concert. Fran said the singer didn’t want to bring her in his hotel room because his friends would think it was weird she was 17 and that he wanted to perform oral sex on her but she didn’t want that and he’d said they could “get naked but not have sex” and Fran had said she didn’t know what that meant. Then the singer had told intimate secrets about his ex-girlfriend. Paul had idly opened iMovie on his MacBook and they’d been absently looking at it, not recording, as they talked and he accidentally clicked—and quickly closed—one of the movies.“That might be porn. Erin and I made a porn.”“What’s that?” said Fran pointing at “ketamine.”“A drug we used before going to Urban Outfitters.”“It seems like you and Erin have a lot of fun together. Is that true?”Paul said they saw each other once every ten days and usually started “fighting” after one or two days. Fran asked what they fought about. Paul vaguely remembered when, on a large dose of Xanax, alone one night in his room, he fell on his way to his mattress to sleep—pulling down his high chair and causing his shoulder, he discovered upon waking eleven hours later, to bleed heavily from two places into a dark pile on his mattress—only slightly aware that this was unrelated to Fran’s question. Paul remembered when he calculated three divided by two as three-fourths regarding an amount of heroin and vomited steadily eight to ten hours, beginning around noon. He and Erin, who’d been resilient, maybe from weeks of Percocet after her car accident, had  snorted the miscalculated heroin upon waking and, after riding the L train, he’d begun vomiting—near Union Square on streets and sidewalks, in Pure Food and Wine’s bathroom, while walking thirteen blocks south, in Bobst Library’s bathrooms. When they left the library at night he stopped every ten to fifteen feet to vomit nothing and Erin began expressing a previously suppressed concern, insisting Paul drink water. Paul vomited repeatedly after each sip and sat—and, at one point, briefly, lay—on the sidewalk outside a New York University dorm by Washington Square Park, inaudibly mumbling that he was okay and, when Erin said she wanted to call an ambulance, barely perceptibly shaking his head no with a sensation of reluctantly imparting an ancient wisdom. In his room, an hour later, around 9:30 p.m., Erin wanted Paul, covered by his blanket on his mattress, to drink a glass of water and didn’t think he should be lying with eyes closed because people in his situation died by sleeping. After an increasingly tense exchange culminating with Paul “sarcastically,” he thought, chugging the large glass of water—in a display of functioning that probably seemed unlike that of a dying person— Erin, to some degree spitefully, Paul felt, had said she was driving home to Baltimore and, to Paul’s surprise, had left him to sleep alone.“Just . . . things,” said Paul, and laughed a little.Fran was staring at his MacBook’s screen.“Different things,” said Paul.“I’m just curious,” said Fran in a frustrated voice.“I know,” said Paul staring at the cursor on the screen, repeatedly disappearing and reappearing in the same place.“Can I watch some of a movie?”“Yeah,” said Paul. “Which one?”“Your favorite one. Not the porn.”Paul clicked a ninety-two-minute movie beginning in his apartment, when he and Erin had returned for ecstasy because he’d vomited his MDMA. Paul clicked near the end of the movie. Erin was describing, in “the voice,” which they hadn’t used in months, how salmonella was harvested, in the residential area behind McDonald’s.<DMZ DREAM PACKET 9>[SHOPLIFTING AT NYU] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: SHOPLIFTING AT NYU",
    "text": "D: SHOPLIFTING AT NYU Thursday, November 22, 2018 SHOPLIFTING AT NYU About a month later Paul was walking toward the library around 4 p.m. after taking the L train to Manhattan and buying food. He text messaged Daniel: “Not going to Fran’s party. Holding iced coffee, feel potentially very productive. Staying in library tonight.” He walked into New York University’s computer store. He picked up Sony “in-ear” earphones and walked around and removed the security tag. He put the earphones in his pocket. He walked toward the exit. “What do you have in your pocket?” said a short Hispanic woman with short hair. Paul stared at the woman and remembered seeing her standing in a corner sort of looking at him about forty seconds ago.Paul took out his cell phone. “My cell phone.”“You have something else,” said the woman.“I have this,” said Sam holding the earphones.“Where did you get those?” said the woman.“They’re mine, I brought them in.”“You didn’t bring those in. I saw you take them.”“No, they’re mine,” said Paul.“Let me see them,” said the woman.“You caught me,” said Paul grinning. “They’re from this store.”“Okay, just stand here,” said the woman. “Don’t move.”Paul thought about running away. His iced coffee would spill a lot. The woman was saying things into a walkie-talkie. A middle-aged man came and walked Paul next door into New York University’s security center.“Are you a student?” said the middle-aged man.“Yes, no,” said Paul. “I’m an alumni.”“He had twenty-eight dollars in his pocket,” said the middle-aged man to another middle-aged man. “How much were the earphones?” he said to Paul.“I don’t know,” said Paul. “I think forty.”“This is your first time being arrested?”“Yes,” said Paul in an uncertain voice.The middle-aged man put Paul’s full iced coffee in a trashcan. The middle-aged man put Paul in handcuffs. Two policemen came about twenty minutes later and asked Paul if he had been arrested before. “Yes,” said Paul slowly. “I mean, I don’t know if I have a record. I had a D.A.T. and I think it was erased from my record after six months, I don’t know if it’s been six months.”“You told me you didn’t have a prior arrest,” said the middle-aged man.“Sorry,” said Paul. “I mean, I didn’t know.”“What were you arrested for the first time?” said the middle-aged man.“Shoplifting,” said Paul.“From the same store?” said the middle-aged man.“No,” said Paul. “From American Apparel.”“Are you going to shoplift again?” said the middle-aged man. “The answer is no.”“No,” said Paul. “I shouldn’t have today. I’m just stupid.”At the police station Paul called Daniel. “Hi,” he said to Daniel’s voicemail. “I’m at the police station on Fifth Street, can you come get my bag? If you don’t come that’s okay. If you come you can eat the grapes in the bag. They’re organic.” Paul did sit-ups on the concrete bench in the cell. The bench was very smooth. Paul did push-ups with his hands on the bench and his feet on the floor. He thought that he would have a headache soon from no caffeine. He looked at a teenage girl in handcuffs on a bench outside the cell. “What are you here for?” said the girl.“Stealing earphones,” said Paul.“Why did you steal earphones?”“Mine broke,” said Paul.“Earphones are 4.99,” said the girl.“No, but I wanted forty-dollar ones,” said Paul.The girl said she stole from Urban Outfitters. “I was outside, and the guy told us to stop, and I thought about running. I thought there was a sixty percent chance I would get away if I ran and I decided not to run. I wasn’t even the one that stole the most. My friend was holding the bag with everything in it, she ran and got away.”“She got away,” said Paul. “That’s funny.”“Yeah, she just started running. She ran into the subway.”A policeman asked if Paul wanted anything from the vending machine. Paul asked if he could have food from his bag. The food was organic raw vegan “Raweos.” The policeman asked what the food was.“Like, cookie things,” said Paul. “Cookies.”“No, I think we better not do that,” said the policeman.Four people Paul’s age were put in the cell. They sat without talking. The teenage girl began asking them questions. They were college students from Boston who had been caught smoking marijuana on their hotel balcony.“Are you seeing Mimi after this?” said the policeman in the driver’s seat on the way to Central Booking. “I think I’m meeting her and her friends at that bar we were at last night,” said the other policeman. “Are you going right after this?” said the policeman in the driver’s seat. “Yeah, probably I’ll just head over straight after this,” said the other policeman. “Change at the station. Try to get this wrapped up in an hour. I like Mimi.” In Chinatown the police got out of the car. The teenage girl and Paul were in the backseat in handcuffs. The teenage girl said something about “the hot officer.”“Which one,” said Paul.The teenage girl said the one that was driving.“Would you go out with him,” said Paul.“Hell no,” said the teenage girl.“Why not,” said Paul.“I don’t know,” said the teenage girl.They got out of the car and went in a building. Paul remembered having walked past the building maybe two hundred times when he lived nearby a few years ago. Paul stood in line and went downstairs. Someone took Paul’s photo with very bright flash. Paul went further downstairs. Paul was given a peanut butter sandwich and put into a cell with a toilet, a payphone, and about ten people.“What are you in for?” someone said.“Shoplifting,” said Paul grinning.“I knew it the moment you walked in,” someone said.“I don’t hold in farts,” said a bony Hispanic lying on his stomach. A public attorney walked by and two people in the cell asked if they would see the judge tonight. “It’s ten now, they go until midnight on Saturday,” said the public attorney. “You won’t get called tonight, they’ll start again at eight in the morning.”Around midnight a young Asian wearing many layers of clothing was put in the cell. He walked to the trashcan, leaned over it, took out four or five cheese sandwiches, and sat eating very quickly with unfocused eyes. Someone said “damn.” Someone gave the young Asian their sandwich. A window-washer who punched someone in the subway said Central Booking in the Bronx had three floors you had to get through before you got to see a judge. “Be glad we aren’t there,” he said. “I’ve been there. When I was sixteen. People be in there three, four days before they see a judge.” Around 2 a.m. breakfast was given. Paul ate his banana and small box of Frosted Flakes and gave someone his milk. He had a headache. He thought about calling Erin on the payphone. Erin didn’t approve of shoplifting. People started lying on the floor. Paul lay on the floor using his hoodie as a pillow.“Damn, man, you stink,” said the bony Hispanic to the young Asian. “Get your stink-ass in the corner.”The bony Hispanic kicked the young Asian’s back.The young Asian moved in place with two jackets over his face.“Don’t move,” said the bony Hispanic. “You’re fanning your stink.”More people were put in the cell. There was no more room on the floor. Someone spilled their milk and three people stood. “Officer, I spilled my milk, can I get another,” said the person loudly about five times.Around 3 a.m. two inmates came into the cell to mop the floor.“You missed a spot,” said the bony Hispanic. “Come back, you missed a spot.” The inmate with the mop stared at the bony Hispanic with a very angry facial expression. “You weak-ass inmate janitor,” said the bony Hispanic. “You do a six-month stint at Riker’s and you think you’re hard. What did you do? Nine months? Six months for good behavior?” They screamed obscenities at each other. The inmate without a mop held back the inmate with the mop. The inmate with the mop had a facial expression like he was about to do something very out-of-control. Paul looked at a small Caucasian who had talked about stealing designer tuxedos and living under a bridge. The small Caucasian had a bored facial expression. The bony Hispanic was shouting obscenities at the inmate janitors who were now out of view. People were fanning the wet floor with their jackets. Paul lay in a near-fetal position with his hood around most of his face and thought about “Raweos.” He woke around 6:30 a.m. to his name being called. He left the cell and walked past about six other cells. People in the other cells were sitting close together in small groups in front of giant fans. They stared at Paul with round eyes as Paul walked past. “They looked like lemurs,” thought Paul standing with about fifty people in a wide hallway. Paul’s name was called. He walked forward and stood in a line and the line moved upstairs into a large cell with about forty people inside. Around 10 a.m. Paul was called into a very small room where he sat opposite a public attorney. “You have no prior arrests, you’ll get one day community service with a fine,” said the public attorney through bars.“I have a prior arrest,” said Paul.The public attorney stared at Paul.“Don’t say that,” she said. “Don’t tell me that.”“Oh,” said Paul. “Okay. Thank you.”Paul went back to the large cell and sat staring at the window-washer who had punched someone in the subway. The window-washer was talking about different movies he had seen. “How long has he been talking,” thought Paul. “Seems weird.” Someone was talking about punching someone on an airplane to protect his children. About ten people were talking about drug deals. Someone was talking about how many years he would get and then threw his puffy jacket on the floor and smiled and said he was going to take a nap and lay stomach-down on the jacket. Around 12 p.m. Paul’s named was called. He sat on a bench in a courtroom. He received one day of community service.Outside the courthouse he called Daniel.“I thought you were calling because you wanted to go to Fran’s party,” said Daniel. “I was sad.”“That’s funny,” said Paul. “You really wanted to go to her party.”“I was really looking forward to it,” said Daniel, grinning, Paul felt.Paul said he was having dinner with Erin later and that he felt like it would be the last time he would see her because he felt like one of them would start uncontrollably talking a lot of shit about the other person. “I feel like that every time we see each other though,” said Paul. “Then it’s always okay for some reason.”“Do you like her still,” said Daniel.“Yeah,” said Paul slowly. “I think I changed or something … like, I like being around someone who isn’t like me a lot, in some ways, or something. I’m pretty sure I feel happy around her. I think I always feel good after I see her.”[ATLANTIC] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: ATLANTIC",
    "text": "D: ATLANTIC Thursday, November 22, 2018 ATLANTIC A few days later around 1 a.m. Daniel and Paul were on a bus to Atlantic City. Daniel was reading a Bret Easton Ellis novel and Paul was reading printouts of the Wikipedia pages for Texas hold ’em and blackjack. Paul said he was going to eat a giant steak with A1 sauce if he won $2,000 or lost all but $20.Around 5 a.m. at the Tropicana Paul was at a blackjack table and Daniel was at a Texas hold ’em table. Paul text messaged Daniel: “Up 400. Feel like impossible to lose. Want to leave soon?”Daniel text messaged: “Up 17. Coming in 20 minutes.”Around 6 a.m. on a down escalator Paul took a cell phone photo of $800 in hundreds and twenties and sent it to tips@gawker.com. Daniel and Paul walked around looking for a buffet that was open. They took a cab to the other side of Atlantic City. They walked into the Borgata. About twenty minutes later Paul text messaged Daniel: “Lost 600, steak soon. Excited.”Daniel text messaged: “Lost 40, coming now.”“Hey,” he said to Paul at the blackjack table.“I’m just going to lose the rest really fast,” said Paul grinning. “I’ll save twenty dollars for steak.” Three people Paul’s age who didn’t know each other were also at the blackjack table. After a few minutes Paul had $20 left. He and Daniel walked around the casino smiling.“I feel really good,” said Paul. “How do you feel?”“I feel really good also,” said Daniel.“Should we go to the buffet,” said Paul.“I don’t know,” said Daniel. “Do you want to?”“I’m not sure. If we feel good we shouldn’t eat at the buffet, right?”Daniel laughed. “Yeah, we probably shouldn’t eat at the buffet. I mean, I don’t care, if you want to go I’ll go.” They got on a $2 trolley back to the Tropicana. It was around 9 a.m. and sunny. “What about that pizza place,” said Paul pointing at a sign outside the trolley.“I don’t know, do you want to?” said Daniel.“No, not really. I’m not hungry, I think.”At the Tropicana they stood waiting for the bus to New York City.“The Bodega is so far from the other casinos,” said Paul.“What do you mean,” said Daniel. “What bodega?”“That place,” said Paul. “With the sexy waitresses.”“The Borgata,” said Daniel.“It should be called the Bodega,” said Paul grinning. “That’s funny, why would they name it something that sounds like ‘bodega,’ bodegas are like the shittiest stores that exist.”“Do you think you’ll want to come back again?” said Daniel.“I don’t know. I feel like I can’t win. I would just lose all my money. But I feel happy here, I think.”“Do you want an avocado?” said Daniel on the bus.“No thank you,” said Paul and closed his eyes.At Penn Station Daniel got on a train uptown to pet-sit. Paul went to his apartment and slept. The next night they were back in Atlantic City. They walked on the boardwalk by the beach around 5 a.m. “Everyone here seems, like, fucked, but in a good way,” said Paul. “I feel at home here.”They walked into a deli and looked at shriveled potatoes.“We should have a party here,” said Daniel on the street.“We should just move here,” said Paul.“I feel like if I lived here I would just wake up every day and eat pizza, and play poker for two hours, and go home and watch TV, and drink beer,” said Daniel.They walked past a strip bar and a house with a “For Rent” sign.“I just want to be crying in someone’s arms,” said Daniel.They walked silently for an hour along the beach. The sun was rising above the Atlantic Ocean. Paul looked at Daniel and saw, to his mild surprise, that he was crying, and feeling a warming sensation of entering his body in medias res, at a moment when a decision, approved without his input, was about to actualize, said “what is DMZ?” at a volume to no one, it seemed.“Nothing,” said Daniel. “I made it up.”Daniel wiped his face with the back of his wrists and grinned at Paul.“Those pills were for indigestion, I thought it was funny how you just ate them like that, I wanted to mess with you a little, I guess.”“Oh,” said Paul, staring transfixed at the sand several feet away. A seagull had landed, and sensing they had nothing to offer of interest, within a second, it seemed, flew off, leaving behind a single footprint. “Good one.” [SNOW] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: SNOW",
    "text": "D: SNOW Thursday, November 22, 2018 SNOW Snow was everywhere that Friday, in clumps and hills, glassy and metastasized as SUVs, and none of it white. The sky was a bright and affected gray—lit from some unseen light source, and not really that interesting. People went up and down Sixth Avenue with the word motherfucker in their heads. They felt no emotions, had no sensation of life, love, or the pursuit of happiness, but only the knowledge of being stuck between a Thursday and a Saturday, air and things, this thought and the next, philosophy and action; birth, death, God, the devil, heaven, and hell. There was no escape, ever, was what people felt.Paul himself was dressed lightly, in dark and enveloping colors. He felt of the same endless machinery and danceless, starless trance of the city at night, if a bit cold. He stood on the perimeter of Washington Square Park, waiting for Dana. They were going to a Leftover Crack show. Leftover Crack was a ska-punk band fronted by a person named Stza; their recent CD was “Fuck World Trade,” Paul knew, as he owned that CD.Dana crossed the street quickly, as if over water. She wore a yellow beanie, stood with Paul on the sidewalk. They smiled at each other and nothing else happened. The atmosphere was not conducive to talking. Visibility was low because of a fog. In the distance, vague things were falling or rising between the buildings. Bats, flying trash. Werewolves, throwing themselves off of roofs. Dana was holding herself with her own arms, Paul could see. They’d known each other almost since the first college-orientation thing before September 11th, but hadn’t really talked in more than three years. A few days ago they’d met on the street and made plans. Tonight, Dana’s boyfriend was at a boxing seminar or something, was unavailable, so here she was with Paul.In the street, a car idled by, a little off-kilter and without its lights on. An unmanned car, lost in the world. It spun slowly around and continued down the street, backwards and twisting.It began to snow.“Sure you want to do this?” Dana finally said.Paul felt cold. He probably should’ve worn more clothing. The show was in Brooklyn, he knew, and they were in Manhattan. “Um,” he said.“I want to do something with you still,” Dana said.Paul looked at her. His eyes were very dry. He could feel his contact lenses there, little walls in front of his eyes. He yawned and Dana went out of focus, a bit wild and diagonal in the air, as if about to travel through time. There was snow on her beanie. Paul brushed at it. But it was just white dots—smiley faces.“There was this beanie floating through the air the other day,” Dana said. “Minding its own business, and I reached over and plucked it out. Like a flower or something. Not this one I’m wearing now. A different one. This really shitty one.” She smiled, then laughed. “I never say ‘shitty.’ I’ve just been listening to this song. It goes, ‘the world’s a shitty place / I can’t wait to die,’ and at the end he goes, ‘just kidding world / you know I love you.’ ”Paul knew that song. There was nothing to say about it. “They should have beanies with beans on it, not smiley faces,” he said.“Yeah. Anything but smiley faces.”“When I see a smiley face I feel demented.”“What if beans were alive and they all had smiley faces,” Dana said.They talked some more like that. Dana seemed to move closer over time, then began to touch Paul’s shoulder sometimes. Paul didn’t know if this was flirting or what. He knew he didn’t know anything about motivation, the world, the future, the past, or human beings. He knew that Dana was marrying her boyfriend. Actually, he did know many things. But it was maybe too many, and he didn’t care. His knowledge was an indestructible machine, made of a million pieces of metal, and flying—a gigantic, gleaming, peripheral blur that Paul was not at all curious about.A while ago, one night, Paul had eaten the universe, and from then on had felt black and spacey inside, had felt his heart, tiny and untwinkling, in some faraway center, white and tepid as a dot of Styrofoam.Dana had changed her mind. She wanted now to see Leftover Crack. Would not do anything else, no matter what.“I’m doing a film,” she shouted on the train. “I’m filming tomorrow. Want to be in it?”Paul said, “What did you just say?” Then realized what she had said. Then the train started screeching and someone began to play a saxophone. Paul told himself to ask Dana about the film later. There was a building that was Paul’s future, a tall and windowed place that he’d have to enter, and if he didn’t fill it, he’d end up wandering the floors, wheeling around on an office chair, rolling his own body on the carpet, like a log. But then probably that’d be a lot easier. Him in his empty building. Harmless, mute. Irrelevant.Dana shouted something but Paul couldn’t hear. He saw her mouth move in a laugh. “I’m going in there with white and green,” a little girl screamed, “and you’re going to choose green!” Dana took a paper from her pocket, gave it to Paul. A drawing of two whales; one with a fishhook in its mouth, a harpoon in its eye; the other with lipstick, squares for eyes—the saddest-looking whale Paul had ever seen—and a thought bubble:I wish I could round these eyesI don’t like myself but I think I like youGive me a kiss and shred off my faceGive me a very square farewell lookPaul read it and nodded at Dana. She was blushing. She touched her face, grinned, shouted something, took back her paper. They got off the train in Red Hook, Brooklyn. It was very quiet here. Snow had come down from heaven, swirled about, absorbed all the smoke and dust—all the coppery, spray painted wooziness of a city—and then fallen, thwarted, to the black and coagulated ground, stopped on its way to hell. There was not a deli anywhere, and no buses. A police van was ahead.“Show’s over,” a policeman in the van said. “Concert’s canceled.” Paul and Dana kept walking toward the venue, a bit quicker. “Turn around and go home,” the policeman said. “There’s nothing here for you two.”Paul and Dana turned slowly around.“Just kidding!” the policeman said. “Hey!”As Paul and Dana walked by, the policeman smiled at Paul. Because of snow, they had to walk within touching distance of the van. All the cops inside, Paul saw, were distinctly different in body size. Maybe a dozen cops, all in jackets. “Have fun,” the policeman said.The venue was Polish-owned, had an outside area where kids smoked and where three Polish women—a mom, her daughters—sold hot dogs, vegetarian hot dogs, chips, and an orange, potion-y drink, which was in a large punch bowl. A hundred or so kids were out here.Paul thought of saying something. He hadn’t for a while. But he felt very calm, and a little dizzy; felt as if washed out by some sweet and anesthetic water, as he often did. Kids were moving in and out of shadows, being loud or elusive, eating chips or smoking. They were sad and pretty in their anguished and demonic colors, their piercings, their hands in their pockets. The bassist for Leftover Crack, Paul recognized, stood alone, eating a hot dog that was not vegetarian, drinking the orange drink.Dana was looking at Paul. “I’m taking a vampire class,” she said. “We just watch vampire movies.”Something black and warped was rippling through Paul’s head, little voids, and he couldn’t concentrate. Probably it was unacceptable to be distracted in this way, he knew, by nothing—by nothingness. It took him a minute or two to respond. “Is Bram Stoker a vampire?” he finally said.“Bram Stoker,” Dana said. “Are you a vampire?”“Yes,” Paul said. Leftover Crack’s bassist was looking down into his orange drink. “I was a cat when I was five, for Halloween. With a cape.” A cat from three to eleven, then a boy with a ghoul mask, then nothing. Halloween quickly became mostly for vandalism; no one dressed up anymore, just destroyed property, attacked one another openly and in teams. It was a different world back then. There were a thousand different worlds in the world, Paul knew. Each had a hundred thousand secrets locked-up in invisible steel rooms in the bright blue sky. Before bedtime, each night, you took a multiple-choice test based on those secrets. You never knew if you failed or what, and each morning you woke with the uncertainty of that. You also woke with a craving for new and requited love. The craving was unrelated to the uncertainty. Both were loyal only to their own causes. You yourself had no cause and seemed, at times, to be simply the effect of something. Fixed, unstoppable. Existing by momentum only, but pretending always otherwise.“That’s good for five,” Dana said. She touched his elbow. “Paul, you were a vampire cat.”“Look at the bassist.” Paul extended his arm straight out and pointed, startling himself in a dull and private way—he hadn’t meant to point like this. Some kids saw Paul pointing and looked. The bassist noticed and moved the hot dog down to his side, held it there like it wasn’t a hot dog, but something insurgent—a microphone or pipe bomb.Dana laughed. “You’re embarrassing him!”She slowly pulled Paul’s hand down.“There aren’t enough songs against McDonald’s,” Paul said. “There should be a song called ‘Fuck McDonald’s.’ ” He felt suddenly excited, and looked directly into Dana’s face. He was not afraid. There was her face. At night, it would move through his vision, colorless and behind the eyes, like a phantom, floating bird—a hood of wings, folding away. “Do you think McDonald’s is objectively bad?”“I think so,” Dana said. “Yeah; I agree with you.”Paul looked away. Leftover Crack, he knew, had a song called “Fuck America”—it had begun to play in his head. It was catchy. It had rhyming couplets.McDonald’s will bloom as the major competitionBetween Jesus and the Devil for this government’s religionPeople so caught up in the freedom that they seeWhile America’s fucking over every single countrySomething Something Chorus SomethingFuck AmericaFuck AmericaFuck AmericaFuck America(Outro)Dana was talking about if she were Bill Gates. “I’d do things about McDonald’s,” she was saying. “I’d end the McDonald’s corporation somehow. With Windows software.”“They’ll sue you.” Paul didn’t feel excited anymore. He felt drugged and indifferent. Something enormous and depressed and on drugs had moved through him; had been watching him, from a distance, and had now come and moved through him.“I’ll sell them faulty windows that would keep breaking,” Dana said. She laughed. “So their restaurants will look all dilapidated. When they sue me I’ll bribe the Supreme Court. I’ll give them supercomputers. Paul, I really like supercomputers for some reason. They’re so big and sad. I just want to take care of them. I get these urges …”Paul wondered if Dana talked this way to her boyfriend. He knew nothing about Dana’s boyfriend. Except that his name was Tyson, and all Paul could ever think was Mike Tyson. Paul liked Mike Tyson. He didn’t know much about Dana anymore. They had talked a lot at first, years ago, that first August before school, before September 11th—all day, walking up and down Manhattan, side to side, through parks—but Paul couldn’t remember any specifics unless he tried very hard, and he didn’t feel like trying that hard.Leftover Crack had a history of inter-band disputes. At a show Paul had attended, the guitarist had left the venue after Stza became depressed and smashed his guitar—the body snapping cleanly and quietly from the neck, as if willingly—and sang a few songs lying flat on his back. Another time, at CBGB, a few months after September 11th, the guitarist had on a fawn-colored sweater over a crisp white shirt for some reason and had said, in a sincere way, that he was proud to be an American, that it really moved him how everyone had come together. Then Stza had said that September 11th was the greatest day of his miserable life. Then they had played “Stop the Insanity (Lets End Humanity),” or something.On stage now, Leftover Crack’s bassist walked to his bass, picked it up, strapped it on, and stood waiting for the others. His face was expressionless and he did not move his eyes, mouth, head, or legs. His shirt said “NO-CA$H.” The guitarist was asking the crowd for beer. Someone passed up a shiny blue plastic cup, but it wasn’t beer.“Somebody pass this fucker a beer,” Stza said.“If I don’t get a beer,” the guitarist said. “I’ll put my guitar down, smoke some crack, drink a forty. Seriously, I don’t care.” He had just done a set with his own band; he had his own band.“We all know, dude,” Stza said. “We all know.”They played “Gay Rude Boys Unite (Take Back the Dance Hall),” their anti-homophobia song, “Money,” their anti-money song, “Life is Pain,” their anti-breeding song, and “Suicide (A Better Way),” their pro-suicide song. Behind them, against the wall, was a large upside-down American flag with a pentagram drawn over it in black marker. In the corner was a little silvery “666.”Paul and Dana stood to the side, back a little. Both had toilet paper packed in their ears. About ten songs in, Dana pushed Paul toward the middle and front. They were squished, were pushing forward and screaming the lyrics, and then Paul fell back into a circle-pit area, was okay for a while, moving quick and unharmed, but then was elbowed some place and smacked in the side by someone’s fat, hard body. He fell to the ground, which was cool and sticky. Kids picked him up, righted him, squared his shoulders. “My shoe,” Paul said. “My shoe fell off.” Kids began to search for his shoe. Then someone was slapping Paul’s cheek with his shoe and giving him his shoe. Paul saw some yellow and pushed up front. Stza was dancing something like a jig on stage, rapping, “incarcerate the youth of the next generation / and you get the high-fives at the police station.” Paul screamed the lyrics for a few songs. Leftover Crack played “Born to Die,” their usual closer—“I just can’t escape the lying / the moment we’re born, we’re dying”—and right after that the venue people turned on the lights. The house music was death metal. Paul found Dana and they stood around for a while. They used the bathroom. They wandered to the outside area, where a girl was interviewing Stza.“Alright,” the girl was saying. She had bright orange hair and a large tape recorder, and was young, maybe in 8th grade. “So what’s the point of what you’re doing? What do you hope to gain?”“Well, the point …” Stza said. “Actually we’ve pretty much done everything I had hoped to do. I wanted to be in a band, I wanted people to come to our shows. I didn’t have a lot of friends growing up and I wanted to meet people … see, I’m really shy, and I just can’t walk up to people and talk to them. I feel like a total jerk. But if kids come up to me and talk I can just talk back.”“Is this the one important thing about the band … that you are going to extremes just because you’re making a point of free speech?”“That’s one of the things,” Stza said. “But it’s not the only reason I say some things. I mean a lot of the things I say. I joke about a lot of things. But only half joking.”“Is that why you have satanic imagery on your website? To be offensive?”“Yeah, yeah. I mean, I’m an atheist. I like satanic art, I think it’s pretty … I’m not a Satanist, but if you read the Satanic Bible, a lot of it is just common sense, really. It’s not about hurting people, it’s about freedom and autonomy.”One of the Polish women—the mom—was watching and had been moving closer and was now standing next to Stza. She asked about some beers that were sitting on a fence. “I wonder whose they are,” she said. There were three beers.“Don’t know. You can have them,” Stza said.“No; you should have them. They’re not mine.”“Thank you,” Stza said.“I wish someone would have them so they wouldn’t just be sitting there.”“I’m sure someone will have them,” Stza said.“Okay. Goodbye.” She turned to leave.“Goodbye,” Stza said. “Well, you know, I eat out of the garbage, so …”The polish woman turned back around. “What?” she said.“I eat out of the garbage, so it doesn’t matter,” Stza said. “A lot of kids do, so they’ll drink the beers.”“I don’t think they’re garbage, I think they’re sealed cans, just over there—look.”“I’ll go check it out if it makes you happy,” Stza said.“Just chuck them over the fence into that garden.”“No! That’s wrong,” Stza said. “I don’t believe in littering. This is such a pretty place.”“But someone might use them to throw at people’s windows.”“They’re empty aluminum cans, that’s not going to break a window. I know these things.”“He’s too smart for me,” the woman said to Paul and Dana. She smiled at Paul. “Oh,” Paul said, and looked away. Dana was holding his hand, he saw. “Will you put them in the bin for me then?” the Polish woman said. “They worry me.”“Alright,” Stza said. “When we go back we have to go back that way—so we will.” He looked around. The little girl with the orange hair was gone. She had vanished.“Thanks,” the woman said, “you’re an angel.”“Thank you. An angel of death.”Outside the venue, the sky was a distinct brown. Kids pointed at it. “What the fuck is that?” someone said. “It’s a piece of doo-doo,” someone screamed. There were clouds but those were brown too. A group of kids began to chant, “Don’t dis the sky, don’t dis the sky.” No one wanted to go home. Everyone loitered in the street, kicked at snow, talked shit about Good Charlotte. Paul walked around a little and soon couldn’t find Dana. He stood in one place, looking and shivering, feeling an unpleasant and comprehensive longing for tonight; it was a thousand years later and Paul was thinking back, remembering—regretting everything. But he would not be alive in one thousand years, he knew. He would be alone in a vast and unimaginable place. He felt a little confused. He saw Leftover Crack’s bassist running away, sprinting down the block, slowing, turning a corner. Then a girl was asking Paul his name. “Paul,” Paul said. “Hi,” the girl said. She had round and vapid eyes and a very thin, silver hoop in her nose. “I’m Maura. Join me, Frank, Donnie in a Chinese dinner. We’re going to Manhattan Chinatown. You’re invited.”Dana walked up.Maura introduced herself again. They talked briefly about a building across the street, then buildings in general. What if they got so tall that they broke off into outer space? “You two are together,” Maura said after a while. “You aren’t alone and feeling bad … feeling alone,” she said to Paul. She gazed at them. “Things haven’t changed. You’re both invited.”The moon was fuzzy and it looked like it had snowed there too, or else it was a large piece of snow, falling slowly, carefully, in an orbit. It was the moon, and could do what it wanted.“You two aren’t very curious,” Maura said. “Not a good sign. Hmm. Look. Frank and Donnie.” She stepped aside, pointed behind her. Frank and Donnie were standing there, small and indistinct, down two or three blocks.At the Chinese restaurant, Maura had an idea that everyone should spend all their money tonight; they’d found a homeless person on the train and he was here with them too—a short, bearded man who hadn’t said anything. They put their money together, a little over a hundred dollars. Maura brought the cash to the large Chinese woman in charge of the place and asked her to order for them, and keep twenty percent for tip. A waiter appeared and engaged the Chinese woman in conversation without looking at her.Dana’s cell phone rang. It was her boyfriend and she said that she was going to go now, and stood up.Paul wasn’t thinking that he wouldn’t ever see Dana again after tonight. He didn’t think of that until after Dana had left. It was later, now, that Paul realized: when Dana was standing by the table, a few minutes ago, looking, she was waiting for him to stand up, so that they could say goodbye or something, exchange phone numbers maybe, but Paul had just sat there, without moving—had been thinking about Dana’s film, about asking her where to meet tomorrow, if she was just being nice; then about how good and mysterious it was that Dana had held his hand earlier—and then she had come over, leaned down, hugged him, and left.“I wonder if Stza masturbates to celebrities,” Frank was saying. “What about to nine eleven? That’s so dumb, when people say that. Getting off on nonsexual things, I hate that shit.”“He probably masturbates to the idea of masturbating to nine eleven,” Donnie said. “He’s one step ahead like that. That’s how people are. There’s like five steps, and you figure out what kind a person you are by what step you’re on. Fuck you, Mrs. Johnson.” He said to Paul, “Um, my math teacher. She was in my head just now. I was like, what are you doing …”“What if someone wrote a song called ‘Fuck Africa,’ or something?” Frank said. He had a worried look on his face. “ ‘Fuck Black People.’ A song called ‘Fuck Native Americans.’ ”Maura was leaned over the table, her head low, and was gazing up, a bit blankly, at Paul. “Are you offended?” she said.Paul shook his head no.“You’re crestfallen,” Maura said.“I’m not.”“Crestfallen?” Donnie said. “Nice. I like that. Romantic.”“What if Stza saw a slide,” Frank said. “Like a playground slide. In a field somewhere. And he was alone and no one was watching—would he do it?”“He’d probably hide in it—on top—and masturbate to the idea of hiding there and masturbating,” Donnie said. “See how we’re different? I’m on one step, you’re on another, lower step. Me and Stza are pointing and laughing at you.”“No … because I’m being serious,” Frank said. “I’m on an elevator or something, being serious.”“I’m operating your elevator,” Donnie said. “Your elevator’s a cardboard box. You live in a cardboard home and sit there being serious all day. At night, you make beastlike noises, you clutch your face in horror …” Donnie looked off to the side at something.“He would—he’d do the slide,” Frank said. “I wouldn’t though. I’d be too apathetic. I’d be like, what difference does it make? Stza would be like, ‘Hey, a slide.’ Stza wouldn’t get along with bin Laden.” Frank was shaking his head. “Stza would be all sarcastic and bin Laden wouldn’t get it. They’d just have all these awkward silences. Bin Laden would murder Stza in his sleep.”“Apathetic is pathetic with an ‘A,’ ” Donnie said.“Osama bin Laden,” Maura said. “Ouch.” Her head lay on its side, on her arms, on the table. Her eyes were closed. “I feel so alone when I close my eyes and talk. I hear my voice and everywhere else is this sad music, like, behind me.” She began to hum, very quietly, “La-la-mm-mm-la, ah-ah-mm …”“Did she say sad music or sadistic music?” Donnie said. He put his hand in the air. “Give me five,” he said to Frank. “Give me a high-five for what I just said.”Frank looked at Donnie. “I wonder if bin Laden ever gets depressed,” he said. “I’m serious. I think about this a lot. Depressed people … are so depressed and harmless. Bin Laden and everyone, Bush—they’re always grinning on TV. What the fuck is that. No one ever thinks about this shit, really.”There was a metal rod inside of Paul. The rod went up from his stomach into the middle of his head. It was made of steel and sugar, and had been dissolving inside of Paul for ten or fifteen years, slow and sweet, above and behind his tongue; and he would taste it in that way, like an aftertaste, removed and seeping and outside of the mouth. Sometimes he’d glimpse it with the black, numb backs of his eyes. But what he really wanted was to wrench it out. Cut it up and chew it. Or melt it. Bathe in the hard, sweet lava of it.Their food came. Three dishes, then three more, then a pot of something murky and deep. The large Chinese woman sat down with them. “I sense a new person,” Maura said. “Hi.” Her eyes were still closed. “It’s the boss-lady,” Donnie said. Maura sat up, opened her eyes, asked the Chinese woman about getting some more homeless people to come help eat. The Chinese woman laughed. She shouted something and the waiter left the restaurant on a bike.The short homeless man was eating and so was Paul, but no one else.“My phys-ed teacher-person called me ‘homeslice’ yesterday,” Frank said. “What the hell is that? He kept doing it.”“He probably said he needed to go home and slice some pizza,” Donnie said. “I’m going to go home, slice some pizza.”“No, he was like, ‘Frank, homeslice, get over here and do twenty push-ups.’ ”“You should’ve said, ‘Your mom’s a homeslice.’ Then stayed where you were, doing zero push-ups.”“I feel depressed,” Frank said.“Do you know?” Maura said to Paul. “What is a homeslice? You’re older than us. You’re wiser.”“Crestfallen,” Donnie said.Paul looked up and shook his head. Blood moved slowly and disproportionately through his head, like a water and a syrup both. He concentrated on eating a piece of vegetable. It wouldn’t fit in his mouth and he concentrated on that.“You seem hungry,” Maura said. “Are you undernourished?”“Are you a reporter?” Donnie said. “I’ve had this … bad vibe, that you’re a reporter from USA Today. When I saw you, the headline came into my head, ‘Teenage Terrorism Gangs at Punk Shows,’ and it had a bar graph. I was like, that’s not right, that’s fucked up—the bar graph, I mean.”Frank began to eat. He had a damaged, pensive look on his face. He ate rice.“I don’t think you are,” Maura said. “Your posture.” She gazed at Paul. “Reporters wouldn’t dare have your posture. Reporters have horse eyes. You have dog … bird eyes. You don’t move your head to look at something, you move your eyes.”“I’m going to carpet bomb the Super Bowl with my al Qaeda friend, who lives on Second Avenue and …” Donnie said. He stared at Paul, who was looking down, at all the vegetables that he had moved onto his plate. There was a withered piece of carrot, a mushroom, a pile of baby corn, and an enormous green thing.“Reporters aren’t as hungry as you,” Maura said.Frank stood up. “I’m going to the bathroom to vomit,” he said, and went there.“I like you, Paul,” Donnie said. He looked around. “I mean it. I usually hate all people. You should come to my birthday party next week. I don’t have friends. Just these people here, and they don’t even like me. Frank. Ha. I don’t ever talk this much. I’m probably on anti-anxiety drugs right now. I’m always like, ‘I hate you, what’s the point of talking.’ Or I’m walking around and I’m all like, ‘I’m normal. I’m a normal person. Fuck all these weirdoes.’ Really, I’m probably exactly like you. Exactly. You should see me at school. I stare at the wall. There’s this wall. Anyway.” His voice was wavering a bit. He took out a 3 × 5 note card and set it in front of Paul:Donnie’s birthday extravaganzaNo clowns, no presents, no singing, fuck no, no cake, no nothingSure to be a depressing time for everyone involvedYou shouldn’t even come, pleaseThe waiter came back with his bike and three other people—his twin, a tall and bearded man, and a tiny, wrinkled, peanut-colored woman. They pulled up another table and sat down. The waiter went and got more soup and bowls.“These are gargantuan,” the short homeless man said. He held his bowl up to the light and everyone looked. It was a normal-sized bowl.The tall man smelled a little sour. He was sitting by Paul, and now stood up. “Thank you, sir,” he said to Paul, and sat down.Paul said something shocking yet compassionate, but he wasn’t sure what exactly—or if, even, as he didn’t hear his own voice and also had been thinking about something completely else.“Thank you, Paul,” the short man said.“Thank you, Paul, sir,” the tall man said.The tiny, wrinkled woman was smiling very pleasantly. She had a little teacup in front of her. The waiter’s twin had on a “NASA” hoodie and was talking to Donnie. “We lived in Seattle then moved here. We’ve written four film scripts each, eight in total. We have a shared identity but we also have distinct individual identities. Well, what do you think?”Frank came back. His face and hair were wet, his eyes were unfocused, and his seat had been taken. He stood there a while, then focused his eyes, put food on a plate, sat alone at an adjacent table, and ate.“You’re trying to say something,” Maura said to the tiny, wrinkled woman, who was moving her lips in an unhurried, fishlike way. Some spit got onto her chin and she coughed a few times. Little coughs, like drops of water. Finally she very clearly and quickly said, “What are your movies about?” She did not have an accent. They were all looking at her.“That depends. Wait … do you mean plotwise?” the waiter’s twin said. “Wait,” he said loudly.They all continued looking at the tiny woman. She was very wrinkled. She began to cough again, then reached for a napkin and knocked over her teacup, which was filled with something not easily describable. It wasn’t tea. There was food in it, and a small mound of sugar or something. “Oh shit,” she said, softly and without agitation, and then carefully stood and walked slowly out of the restaurant.“I think what she meant?” the waiter said, looking at his twin. “Was overall, as in what are our preoccupations?”“Life,” the twin said quickly. He stared at his brother, the waiter. “What, you don’t think so? I hesitated earlier. I shouldn’t have. We’re different.”Maura stood. “Let’s go help her,” she said, and pulled Paul up. As she and Paul left, the waiter was saying, “She’s not as old as you think. She uses the internet, you know? Friendster?”It was snowing outside. Paul felt cold, but in a stony, immune way. He was a marble statue, unearthed after a hundred million years—fascinating. The woman stood on the corner, small and shoulderless as a penguin. The wind lifted her hair above her head, like a small, white flame.“We’ll each hold one of her arms,” Maura said. They went and did that.Maura leveled her face with the woman’s and asked where they were going, then positioned her ear directly in front of the woman’s mouth. Maura’s nose ring was very bright. Paul stared at it and could hear it shining. It was a noise like a happy person waking from a nap—continually waking from a nice nap.The woman pointed across the street. There was a McDonald’s, glowing yellow and red in complex, ongoing, and freakish acknowledgement of itself. As they crossed the street, Paul couldn’t see that well; snow moved elaborately toward his face, in curlicues and from below. But he felt that he could hear better. He could hear their six shoes sloshing against the snow. It was a crumbling noise, he realized, only faster.Inside McDonald’s it was very warm. They sat in a booth by the entrance. The woman said she wanted an Oreo McFlurry, but had no money.“You don’t need money,” Maura said. “Don’t move.” She stood and went to the back, to the ordering counter.The woman began to shiver. Paul took off his jacket and put it on her back. She touched her ears. “It’s cold here,” she said. “These places.” She touched her forehead and eyebrows.Paul pulled the jacket up, covering her head completely. It looked like it put an uncomfortable weight on her neck. Paul slid in close, right next to her, and held the jacket up a little.“That’s pretty good,” the woman said. “I don’t like the city. No, never. Don’t ask me that.” She began to talk faster and louder. “I’m moving to the Florida Keys. I’m not driving. I’m taking a plane. I’m living in a hut on the beach.” She paused, then coughed.“Oh,” Paul said.“Everyone’s doing something and that’s what a city is,” the woman said. “I’m old. I don’t want to communicate at the speed of light on Mars. My daughter died in the towers. She didn’t need to be there, typing, doing things at the speed of light. Not my daughter but other daughters. I mean—people. Something. I can’t get at the things in my head. They’re tiny. They move too slow.” She was coughing or sobbing now—or both; there was a sound like two or three hamsters squeaking. Paul leaned over to look at her face, but it was just a shadow under the jacket, an abyss. “Where were you when the towers happened?” she said.“Sleeping.”“Singing? What?”“Sleeping.”“Oh, that’s good. So don’t wake up. Build a home by a beach. Leave the city and get a bed. Those are important. Beds. Don’t wake up through any of this, ever. Don’t dream about cities or progress. Don’t wake up or dream. That’s what I’m saying. Is that wrong? What should I say then? It’s too late to say anything.”“It’s … what time is it?” Paul said inaudibly.Maura came back holding a McFlurry and with a McDonald’s manager following her. She set the McFlurry down and sat opposite the woman and Paul. The McFlurry had some ice cream smeared on its outside and no cap on top.The manager stood by the booth. “None of you have money?” he said. He was extremely tall and was staring down at Paul. “I believe that. I’m not self-righteous. Listen,” he said. He stared at Paul without blinking. “Okay. Listen. ‘From anyone who takes away your coat, do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you, and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again.’ Listen; just keep listening. ‘Students of Buddha should not take pleasure in being honored, but should practice detachment …’ ” He continued on like that.Paul’s eyes were very dry. He was staring back at the manager, wide-eyed, and when he finally blinked, both his contact lenses crinkled and fell out, onto his cheeks. He brushed them quickly off his face.The manager stopped talking and affected a sudden, neutral expression. He stared at Paul’s contact lenses, which were on the table.“Do you need something for those?” the manager said slowly. “Yeah. I think you need alcohol solution to clean them, now that they’re dirty.”“It’s good to not wear them sometimes, for a change,” Maura said. “Once a year … week.”They were all looking at the contact lenses, which were squirming a little, slowly unfolding.The old woman was weeping and coughing very quietly.Paul brushed at the contact lenses until they fell off the table. He was blushing hard and was sweating a little in some places. He rested his hands in his lap, and felt them there—light as gloves, gentle and dead as birds.The manager took from his pocket a colorful wad of Monopoly money. He stuffed that quickly back in his pocket, then took a five-dollar bill from another pocket. “Here,” he said. He set it on the table, looked at it, flattened it out. “That’s five … real dollars.” He smiled and looked very happy. He smiled less after a while, then renewed his smile, then left.“People can be so nice,” Maura said. She was looking at the woman. “Maybe you shouldn’t eat that freezing-cold … you’re shivering. You’re hyperventilating.”The woman moved the McFlurry into the dark area below the jacket and the weeping noise stopped.Maura climbed over the table and held the woman. She set the side of her head lightly against the woman’s back and closed her eyes. “I’ve wanted to ask about your friend Dana,” she said after a while. It was snowing very hard outside; snow was flying against the glass then vanishing, quiet and rescued as the tiny ghosts of baby doves. Everything else outside was a lucid and excited black. “What do I want to know?” Maura said. “I don’t know. Something.” She began to hum loudly.Paul had been thinking about the week after September 11th, had been thinking about that for a long time—but wasn’t anymore. He wasn’t thinking anything anymore. He was the effect of some inception. There was the first thing, and then so on, all the rest being effect, and there was nothing Paul could do about that. If he was going to feel this way, then he was going to feel this way. Feelings were a part of the effect too. The effect was everything, and forever. It couldn’t be changed or gotten out of.But Paul wasn’t thinking or feeling any of this, really.It was all just there, in him—what he’d think or feel if he were to. It was a leaf, waiting for him. His heart was a leaf. A white leaf, inside a gigantic noise.September 11th, that Tuesday, Paul had called Dana’s room and left a message. He called again the next day and left another. It was the second week of college and Paul didn’t know anyone. He spent that week lying awake in his room, listening to music, not eating barely anything. Mostly just thinking about Dana. Waiting for her call.By Friday, Paul had convinced himself that Dana hadn’t called because she had left the city; a lot of people had—his roommate had. Though, really, he wasn’t sure, as he’d been thinking about when they last hung out. It had been different than the times before. They hadn’t had fun really—not nearly as much as at first—and hadn’t made plans. But then maybe she had just left the city.It wasn’t until a few months later—after Dana met her boyfriend—that Paul found out she had been across Washington Square Park all that week; she hadn’t left, hadn’t called.But that was later.On Friday, Paul could still feel a little less lonely thinking about Dana.That night they were showing movies for free at Union Square, and Paul went. There were many homeless people, all of them alone. No one wanted to sit by a homeless person—with their puffy, Godless coats; their animal largeness—but then every seat filled, and some people had to. Paul was a little dazed, watching this, and had stopped, for a time, feeling sorry for himself, but for everyone else—everything. The movie was very independent and very sad. Outside, the streets were closed to cars. People walked on them. Missing-person flyers were taped over ads and poles. It was very quiet without any cars. Paul felt vast and detailless and disembodied; it was the same tired and endless feeling everywhere, he felt, inside of him and out—in the stung and ashen air, the buildings tall and pale as apparitions, the strange and lowered sky. Paul didn’t want to go back to his room. He walked around for a very long time, looking down at the sidewalks and streets, and thought of the things he and Dana might say to each other if she were with him. And every once in a while he would catch himself smiling and laughing a little, and it was those moments right after—as, having lapsed into fantasy, there was a correction, a moment of nothing and then a loose and sudden rush, back into the real world in a trick of escape, as if to some new place of possibilities—that he felt at once, and with clarity, most exhilarated, appreciative, disappointed, and accepting.[FLORIDA] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: FLORIDA",
    "text": "D: FLORIDA Thursday, November 22, 2018 FLORIDA Paul talks to Daniel on the phone then drives to Domino’s. “You’re late,” Matt says. “You’re fired. Get your shit and get the fuck out of here.” There are two managers and one is Matt. The other manager is the sad manager.Paul grins. “Okay,” he says.Matt stares at Paul. “I don’t want to see you again, Paul.” Matt is twenty-five, singer and guitarist of his own band, and Paul is making a shit-eating grin at him. Paul goes to the back, feels tired of life, and logs in. Four other drivers are standing around. Paul has nothing to say to them. They live in small houses with low roofs and are all very polite. One was a martial arts champion. Paul had a flat tire once and the martial arts champion drove out to help, late at night. He seemed very nice and a little shy, but also like if he wanted he could walk quietly through a crowd with a neutral facial expression breaking people’s bones. Paul kept apologizing; he felt bad because one time the martial arts champion had showed him how to save fifteen seconds by driving through a field illegally. “Thank you for helping me,” Paul said. The martial arts champion said his wife hit a deer and after that would not drive anymore. He said he used to go places for martial arts competitions. He went to Virginia and Georgia. “I was pretty serious,” he said. “I did martial arts one summer,” Paul said. The martial arts champion was changing the tire; they were in front of a rundown grocery shack; and Paul kept thinking, martial arts, deer, death. He was not surprised or afraid, but a little bored. Driving home that night he felt undistracted and grateful. He petted his dogs and emailed his mom. He should be friends with the martial arts champion; with all of them. They once invited Paul to drink beer and watch TV. We’ll eat pizza. They laughed when they said that and Paul smiled and had an image of himself standing in a corner, drunk and depressed, then facedown in a retention pond. At home that night he wondered if he should’ve gone; imagined it would’ve been fun, just to watch—the martial arts champion probably would have gotten drunk and jump-kicked a deer, or something—and after that was not invited again.“Is it busy? Today?” Paul says. He looks abstractly at the other drivers; it’s unfair to look at one person.“It’s been slow this week,” someone says.“Remember when kids said ‘slow-mo’?” someone else says. “I’m bringing it back.”“No you’re not,” Paul says.“Why not?”“I don’t know,” Paul says.The other manager walks by. He is young and overweight, with glasses; ‘the sad manager.’“A moose gave a ten dollar tip,” someone says. “I said, ‘Thank you, moose.’ Moose said, ‘Thank you.’ It was fun.”When there are no deliveries you fold boxes; or take calls. Folding boxes is easier. Everyone is folding boxes. Paul is folding boxes. If the entire job were to fold boxes people would scream. They would fold, and sometimes scream, existentially, then be dragged into a field and beaten into a paste. Sometimes there would be a killing rampage. Daniel was going to San Francisco but got on the wrong plane and is now in Seattle. It’s risky to scream in an airport. Daniel is clinically depressed inside of an airport, homeless; let him live in your closet. Lori, I’ll wear him like a shirt over my head, like a hat, and his ears can be my real ears.“My friend was going to see his dad,” Paul says. “He went to Seattle.”Someone says something about dying from eating too much pizza after sex with a prostitute.Paul feels calm. “If you can’t beat them join them,” he says. Some days he feels calm. Today he feels calm. He feels strange. “Has anyone done that? Not beaten something … then joined it?”“If you can’t join them buy them out,” someone says.“Buy them presents,” Paul says, and makes a shit-eating grin at no one; at a pizza box. He is embarrassed for the pizza box. He folds it. ‘Shit-eating grin.’ He needs to stop. He needs to use his face to convey emotions to other humans in order to move sincerely through life—laughing in groups of three or four; expressing gratitude, concern, or disapproval about people, the weather, or food; and manipulating members of either sex to get them to love him, like him, or respect him. That is what a face is for. One manager isn’t enough so there are two. They should be identical twins. One would make pizzas shaped like pentagrams and have a pointy tail no one would mention but have nightmares about most nights. Eventually the evil twin would go on a killing rampage, which no one would mention but have nightmares about most nights; though sometimes in daytime, during naps. Everyone is folding boxes. Feels like a David Lynch movie. In Manhattan Paul saw Mulholland Drive with a girl. They saw the movie, ate Chinese food. She kept saying she was having a lot of fun. Paul liked her. “I really want to do this again,” she said at her door. “We should,” Paul said. “I’ll call you,” she said. Paul saw her next a few months later, from across a street, and she averted her eyes. Did she avert her eyes? Maybe she was being polite when she said ten times and enthusiastically that she was having a lot of fun. Maybe she was being sarcastic. Maybe politeness is the same as sarcasm. Someone should write that book. Against Politeness. Paul is learning many useful and interesting things while folding boxes for minimum wage. I was folding boxes and writing a book proposal. My face was neutral but inside I felt productive and good. My name is Paul. I am twenty-eight years old, I live in Orlando, Florida, and instead of talking out loud to real human beings that I can touch and look at I talk in my head to humans from my past that I will probably never see again.Matt comes and stares then slowly goes away. Paul laughs. He likes Matt. If Paul makes a movie Matt will be in every scene in the background staring. The trailer will be two minutes of Matt’s face. One time Matt told Paul to deliver a pizza with his hat sideways, shirt untucked, belt unbuckled; and gave him a bike chain to wear around his neck. Paul did it. The man came to the door, terrified. Paul felt abstract and out-of-control. It took a long time because it was a large order, with Buffalo wings and extra bleu cheese. The man’s face turned red and neither of them spoke, even when Paul dropped a container of bleu cheese and they both watched it fall into a little hole in the concrete. It was difficult to get the bleu cheese out because it fit almost perfectly in the strange hole. “What happened,” Matt said. “The person was afraid of me,” Paul said. “You’re a good worker,” Matt said.Sitting in the car after work. Listening to music. (“How do you have fun?”) Paul has not spoken aloud in about three hours. He will never speak again. He is ready to go home. He doesn’t want to go home. He wants to build a tree fort for Lori. Trap her in the tree fort. Matt comes out, gives Paul a pizza, says to deliver it to Joanna’s house and also drive Joanna home. “Don’t rape her, or we’ll know,” Matt says. Joanna is standing there. “Thank you for the awkward situation,” Paul says. “What?” Matt says. “Thank you for the awkward situation,” Paul says. “What?” Matt says. “Thank you for the awkward situation,” Paul says. Matt lights a cigarette. Joanna stares at Paul. She waves. Paul waves. Joanna is four feet from Paul, who is sitting in his car—a Honda Civic—and they are waving at one another. She is a phone person; a high-schooler. She sits in back. Paul feels like a chauffer. Matt is training him, taking Domino’s to the next level in cutting-edgedness. Get rid of the tables; introduce chauffeurs. Paul drives out of the shopping plaza. He will find Joanna’s house without directions. As a boy he was convinced he had extra sensory perception. He read UFO books and was afraid every night. Paul feels sorry for the small boy who sat in the ‘occult’ section of shoppingmall bookstores for hours while his mom bought clothes. He is still afraid sometimes that an alien will be standing in a doorway. He wants to fight an alien in hand-to-hand combat, to overcome his fear; aliens would surround him, headbutt him into a paste—it would take six hours, because of their soft heads, but Paul would be too afraid to object or move—and roll their bodies in the paste. Paul makes a left. He will not talk unless Joanna talks first. He did that with Lori sometimes. He should talk non-stop and never strategize, or think. People would try to get away from him. Finally the police would take him to jail, though in the morning he would be back, in the person’s house, talking loudly. Eventually there would be killing rampages. Eventually there will always be killing rampages.“Make a right back there,” Joanna says. “You were supposed to turn.”U-turn over the median? You win, you lose, it’s the same old news. Paul does it. A cop turns his sirens on. “Shit!” Joanna says. She leans forward and looks at Paul’s face. Paul looks at her. She has a pretty nose, a small mouth. (“Don’t rape her, or we’ll know.”) Paul looks away, parks the car. If he were Lori he would call the cop a motherfucker. Don’t call the cop a motherfucker.“Tell me what happened,” the cop says. He shines a flashlight in back, at Joanna.“He’s giving me a ride home,” Joanna says. “I’m in high-school. We’re co-workers at Domino’s. We just left there.”The flashlight is on Joanna’s face; the cop is looking at Paul. It’s a little confusing. ‘Complex.’“I made a U-turn,” Paul says, and makes a kind of shit-eating grin.“You made a U-turn,” the cop says. “Other people got off work and you will kill them—put them in wheelchairs, hospitals. What are you thinking about, boy?” He wasn’t angry before. Now he is very angry. He called Paul a boy.“I know I’m wrong,” Paul says. He is thinking about marshmallows a little. It is October. “My co-worker’s family ordered a pizza.” He has an image of himself drunkenly resisting arrest; being shot in the back of the head while running away. He is afraid there are kilograms of illicit drugs in the glove compartment. He will fight the cop in hand-to-hand combat. Don’t make sudden movements; not yet. The cop leaves. Paul promises to himself sarcastically—it is impossible for Paul to make a sincere or unselfconscious promise to himself—to never make a U-turn again. Not even a legal one. It’s good he wasn’t wearing a bike chain. The cop returns with a $180 ticket. “Thank you,” Paul says, grinning. He will plead insanity in traffic court. The cop, He did seem demented. The judge, What does it mean that he’s grinning right now? Courtroom psychologist, Look at that shit-eating grin. Paul, I’m against capitalism, I’m against being against capitalism, and I work at Domino’s pizza. Denny’s waitress, He said I was against capitalism.“Should I sit up here?” Joanna says, and climbs up front. “Why did I sit in back? The cop thought that was illegal. He wasn’t sure.”As a kid Paul was always climbing around in cars. His mom liked it. Paul kind of likes Joanna. Paul likes Lori. Lori, laughing. Joanna doesn’t laugh or smile. Paul looks at her. Joanna looks at him. Paul grins a little. Joanna looks away then ahead. She is afraid. At work she talks nonstop; does she? Paul never paid attention. He puts on very sarcastic and depressing music. She used the window instead of using the door /now I’m alone up on the fourteenth floor. Sarcastic; or polite? Joanna is afraid of this music. Paul will drive them into a wall. Joanna will make a face of agony. Before they die she will shriek and Paul will get a headache. The cop will be very angry and shine his flashlight at a tree while talking about the car. Matt will stare, then walk slowly and backwards into a forest. Lori won’t ever know. She never thinks about Paul; hasn’t ever e-mailed or called. Paul never e-mails or calls either, really, just has imaginary conversations with her almost constantly; his idea of her. Maybe he will e-mail her tonight. She will respond with a form letter. We thank you for your submission but are unable to use your work at this time. Unfortunately, the volume of submissions we receive makes a personal reply impossible. She’ll say she’s moving to Florida and Paul will pet his dogs, e-mail his mom, and buy Daniel a present. She won’t respond and Paul will lie on the floor with a blanket over his face and body.Joanna is saying something.Paul turns down the music. He feels bored. “What did you just say?”“I know this. My sister listens to this. It’s I Hate Myself.”“No one listens to I Hate Myself,” Paul says.“I just said my sister listens to I Hate Myself.”Paul wants to meet Joanna’s sister for dinner.“I live here,” Joanna says.After eating salads with Joanna’s sister they will listen to music and kiss. After eating salads with Joanna’s sister they will avert their eyes. To be polite she will swear to God she’s having fun, and take a lie detector test. She won’t be Lori. Lori is better. Lori didn’t listen to I Hate Myself. ‘Complex.’ ‘Shit-eating grin.’ Shit-eating grins are complex. Why would you grin if you just ate shit? A neighborhood is passing on the right. Joanna’s neighborhood. Paul in his head has an image of a mouth larger than Paul’s head and the mouth is laughing. Sometimes reading or watching TV Paul recognizes that a thing is meant to be funny and hears this laughter, in his head, then feels that his face is very calm and neutral, like a hamster’s. At night sometimes Paul’s heart beats fast and his thoughts are illogical and wild. In bed he looks at the ceiling and feels excited and alert, and can’t understand why he, or anything, exists.“You passed it,” Joanna says. “You passed the first turn too; when we left Domino’s. That’s why you made a U-turn and got a ticket.”“The first turn you didn’t say anything; how could I know?”“I did,” Joanna says.“I’m pretty sure you didn’t.”“I swear I said, ‘Turn here, Paul.’ ”“You didn’t say my name.”If Joanna were Lori, Paul would tickle her. He mock jerks the steering wheel to the left. He looks at Joanna. She isn’t looking. One time a kid was roadside on a bike and kept glancing over his shoulder as Paul approached; Paul mock jerked the car and the kid fell off his bike into a ditch. Lori liked that story. Lori called a guy at Duane Reade a motherfucker. Lori’s tongue was very cute, licking her blue Popsicle. Lori Tealsden. Stop thinking about her. Drive Joanna to Joanna’s house.“I’ll turn up here,” Paul says. U-turn. Another promise not kept. Of the two people in the car Paul is the one without a future; the other person, Joanna, will go to college, make myriad friends and life connections, join clubs, get internships, and even marry someone and have children. What was Paul doing the entire time in college? Everyone was constantly busy and partying, or attempting suicide. Paul was always telling people how he’d just slept fourteen hours. He joined a water polo club. He had leg cramps and got out of the pool and winced. The instructor said, “You won’t be coming back again, will you?” Paul said, “Yeah I will.” At a deli Paul saw the instructor and walked up to her and said, “I’ll see you next week.” He did not go back. He turns the music up, puts it to a different song. Pick a happy one. There are no happy ones. There is no future. It goes to a very depressing song by Samiam. I don’t want to spend another long and lonely weekend by the phone without anyone to call / I’ve had a lot of time to think and I’m so tired of thinking I know why he put that bullet in his skull. Sincere, at least. Paul does not know the meaning of the word ‘sincere.’ That can’t be true. Talk to Joanna. Meet her sister. Kill Joanna, her sister, and Daniel. (“Kill me and my siblings.”) Suitcase full of cash; high-fives on a diamond boat. Paul feels sorry for Samiam’s singer who is probably currently listening to I Hate Myself. Paul feels sorry for anything, even inanimate objects and moments in time. He once recorded a song in his room; he feels sorry for those moments in time when a person named Paul recorded a sad song in his childhood bedroom by dubbing drums with guitar then singing a poem over it. He should put the song on the Internet. Name it “Jhumpa Lahiri.” Her Pulitzer Prize would slide into the night and be run over by a car. Lori would laugh. Daniel would comprehend that it was funny but not laugh. Joanna probably would not laugh. Joanna’s sister, maybe (she listens to I Hate Myself). Matt would stare at Paul for ten minutes. It’s depressing that people are different. Everyone should be one person, who should then kill itself in hand-to-hand combat. The chance that Paul and Joanna’s sister would like one another is probably two percent. Einstein, God doesn’t play dice with the universe. When Paul hears something like that his face becomes very neutral and a sarcastic voice in his head says, “Profound.” He doesn’t want to drive anymore. What will he do tonight? (“Go fuck yourself.” “I will. Tonight.”) He wants to drive into a mountain and make the mountain explode. Florida has no mountains. Florida has no Lori. No Lori; no future. No marshmallows. Paul stops thinking.“You passed where you said you would turn,” Joanna says after a while.“I’ll turn soon.” Paul drives thinking, turn at the next one. I will turn at the next one. Mass grave in the side yard. He merges smoothly into the turn lane. (“Tell me what happened.” “I made a fucking U-turn.”) “I’m obsessed with a girl,” he says. “What should I do?”“You’re not obsessed,” Joanna says.“She is Lori. She doesn’t call me. I made her admit she liked me. She likes me. But we’re too alike. When you’re with someone and neither of you can stop saying good things. Then you both get very aware that life will end soon. I think that’s why we don’t talk that much. Do you understand what I’m talking about?”“You’re rationalizing,” Joanna says.Paul drives without thinking.He feels calm. He feels a little good.(“My sister is more depressed than both of us.”)“Are you passive-aggressive?” Joanna says. “You don’t call but expect her to, like she’s your dad.”“She’s not my dad.” Paul’s dad is in Germany. Daniel’s mom’s plane crashed. “I don’t know what ‘passive-aggressive’ means. It’s a cliché,” Paul says. He feels tired. What will he do for the rest of his life? “How old is your sister?”“My best friend’s cousin’s name is Lori,” Joanna says.Best friend’s cousin. “I can’t process what you just said,” Paul says. Daniel’s dad, screaming. “Lori,” Paul says. Everyone should be named Lori. Rename the dogs. Interpret them as one entity. ‘Lori.’“Maybe I know her,” Joanna says. “I think three of her cousins are named Lori. Turn left.” She points at her neighborhood; ‘Windy Brook.’ Paul has an image of himself and Lori sitting by a stream with their feet in the water.“My sister’s twenty-five,” Joanna says. “Why?”Paul turns into ‘Windy Brook.’ “Your sister should start a band with me. My friend Daniel and I are starting a band.” Paul will marry Joanna’s sister. Daniel will feel left out. Killing-rampage.“Ashley plays bass guitar,” Joanna says. “She’s okay at it. I mean really good. I’m not jealous; I don’t know why I said she’s okay. She’s great.”“Everyone should be named Lori.” A bear with a hose on ‘full-blast’ setting, watering flower plants—crushing them, really—stares at Paul’s face as Paul drives by. Paul thinks about squinting or something and blankly stares back at the bear.“My sister is a genius on bass guitar,” Joanna says, and gives some more directions.“I feel like how Honda Civics look. That’s why I drive a Honda Civic,” Paul says. “Just kidding.” He wants Ashley’s phone number. Can I come inside to ‘court’ your sister? Inappropriate. Be patient. Wait ten days; don’t strategize. Wait exactly fourteen days, get her email address under the pretense of starting a band; use the email address to get her phone number; use the phone number to ask her to dinner under the pretense of something else. Wait fourteen days then go on a killing-rampage, culminating in Seattle with putt-putt, in the rain, with Daniel’s dad’s severed arm. She’s twenty-five. Probably in Uzbekistan for the Peace Corps. Paul is twenty-eight. He should join the Peace Corps. He and Lori were going to vacation on the Canary Islands. Paul does not know what the Canary Islands are. She said it, not Paul. They had many ideas and plans. They climbed a tree. Paul drops Joanna off. She runs across her yard with her pizza, jumps over a stump, goes into the house. She could have gone around the stump. It was more fun to leap over the stump, like a gazelle. So that’s how you have fun. Paul sits in his car, feels bored and sarcastic, and starts to drive away. Joanna runs wildly at the car. Paul is confused. Joanna knocks on Paul’s window; she will invite Paul inside to ‘court’ Ashley? Paul puts the window down. Joanna is grinning. Shit-eating? A normal grin. She pays for the pizza. “Thank you, Paul,” she says, and runs away. Paul sits in his car thinking about rafting around the Canary Islands with Lori using an inflatable marshmallow raft. A bear comes out of Joanna’s house.Paul puts the window up.The bear stares at Paul.Paul puts the window down a little.“Do you need something?” Paul says.“Yeah,” the bear says.“Oh. What do you need?”“Come here.”The bear points at a house.“Do you need help?” Paul says.“Come here,” the bear says.“Where?”“Do you want free money?” the bear says.“Why?”“Do you want a hundred dollar bill?” the bear says.“I don’t know,” Paul says. He puts the window down all the way. “Why do you have free money?”“Come here.” The bear steps toward the house he pointed at before.“It’s a trick.”“Yes or no,” the bear says. “Do you want free money and a free laptop computer or not?”“I own a home computer.”The bear has a twenty-dollar-bill and a blue blanket and holds them in front and walks to Paul’s car and puts the blanket on Paul’s head and rips off Paul’s door and the top of Paul’s car. The bear picks up Paul and carries Paul to the house he earlier pointed at and in the side yard sets down Paul, who takes the blanket off his own head. The bear kneels, opens a secret passageway under a patch of grass, and points at a ladder that goes underground. Paul goes to the ladder. “Do it,” the bear says.“Do what?” Paul says. “Why?”“Do it,” the bear says.The bear takes the blanket from Paul and drops it down the passageway.“Oh,” Paul says. “Good thinking. Good idea. Now I’m required to go get the blanket, or else I’ll appear ‘irresponsible,’ or something, an irresponsible human being littering in the wilds of North America. Yeah. I don’t know. Okay.”Paul climbs down the ladder.The bear climbs down the ladder.They climb together.They are climbing.The bear kicks Paul’s head.“Was that your head?” the bear says.Paul doesn’t say anything.“Paul,” the bear says. “Was that your head?”“Stop talking.”“What was it?” the bear says.“A laptop computer.”They keep climbing down.“Where’s your sledgehammer?” Paul says.“Sledgehammer,” the bear says. “What are you talking about?”It gets colder.The bear makes noises like, “Hrr. Hrr.”“Not all bears are the same bear,” the bear says.They climb some more and reach a corridor.Paul picks up the blanket.They walk through the corridor.There is a nook in the corridor.A moose is lying in the nook.The moose’s eyes are open.The bear takes the blanket from Paul.The bear tells Paul to keep walking.“A moose,” Paul says.“Keep walking,” the bear says.Paul keeps walking and reaches a cliff.Below the cliff is a city of dolphins and bears. Sometimes there is a very tall statue of the current president of the United States. Paul recognizes the president’s face.The bear stands next to Paul.“Hrr, hrr,” the bear says.“You’re cold,” Paul says.“It’s a cold and lonely world,” the bear says.“Just kidding,” the bear says. “Sort of.”“I’m going to sit,” Paul says.Paul sits. A dolphin comes from the corridor. Paul stands. The dolphin has a sledgehammer. Paul looks at the sledgehammer; the dolphin slaps Paul’s face. More dolphins come from the corridor. The cliff is crowded. More dolphins come; a dolphin is crowded off the cliff; as it falls it goes, “EEEEE EEE EEEE!” Paul laughs a little. Two more dolphins fall and the cliff is not as crowded anymore. The dolphin with the sledgehammer says, “Watch this.” The other dolphins look. The dolphin with the sledgehammer slaps Paul’s face.“Stupid,” says one of the other dolphins.And throws a smoke bomb.When the smoke clears there are many bears and no dolphins.A bears throws a smoke bomb on the floor.When the smoke clears there is one dolphin. The dolphin slaps Paul’s face, throws a smoke bomb; smoke clears and there is the first bear. Paul looks at the bear, who is taller than Paul.“Are you okay?” the bear says.Paul touches his cheek.It’s swollen.“Are you okay?” the bear says.“I’m okay,” Paul says. “Are you okay?”The bear looks at Paul.The bear kneels and opens a trapdoor.There is another ladder.The bear points at it.Paul feels bored.“No, wait,” Paul says.“What,” the bear says.“I already did that before.”“There’s two more,” the bear says.“I know,” Paul says. “I already went. Uh, the squirrels.”“Hamsters,” the bear says.“I forgot. But I went; do you believe me. The hamsters are sad.”“Go again,” the bear says.“Go again.”“Go again,” the bear says. “It’ll be fun.”“Do you have a name?” Paul says. “Do bears have names?”“Paul,” says the bear.Paul feels nervous. “I’m Paul.”“My name is Paul,” the bear says.“No,” Paul says.“Uh, yes,” the bear says.“Oh,” Paul says.“Go again,” the bear says. “We’ll have fun.”“How will it be fun?”“We are both named Paul,” the bear says. “I don’t know.”“Your name isn’t Paul,” Paul says.“My name is Paul,” the bear says. “What the fuck?”“I don’t know,” Paul says. “I’m stupid. I feel stupid.”“Let’s go,” the bear says.“How will it be fun?”The bear scratches the wall and stares at Paul.The bear looks at Paul.The bear points at the corridor they came from.Paul walks there and stands there.The bear pushes Paul a little.Paul walks through the corridor they came from.He glances at the nook without moving his neck; there are two aliens standing on a moose.The moose’s head is covered with a blanket.Paul keeps walking; the bear is behind him.He makes it to where the ladder is and stands there.“The next time I have to point I’ll also punch you in your face,” the bear says. “And eat you.”“Do it,” Paul says.The bear makes a fist, slowly moves the fist to Paul’s face, touches Paul’s face with the knuckles, with its other hand holds the back of Paul’s head and slowly smushes Paul’s face into the knuckles of its hand that it had slowly moved toward then touched the front of Paul’s face with; the hand is furry.“Stop,” Paul says.The bear stops.“Do it for real,” Paul says.The bear punches the air by Paul’s head.“Do it with good aim,” Paul says. “And with eating. You said ‘and eat you.’ ”The bear climbs up the ladder.“Do it with a free laptop computer,” Paul says. “Or I’ll kill you.”The bear climbs down and stares at Paul.“There’s nothing to do,” the bear says.“I know,” Paul says.The bear looks at Paul.“Why were there statues of the president?” Paul says.“Life is stupid,” the bear says.“I hate life more than you do.”“No,” the bear says.“Yeah.”“No.”“Yeah.”“No,” the bear says and disappears.Paul stands there.Then climbs up the ladder and walks to his car.The door and the top are back.Paul opens the door and the door falls on the street.He drives out of ‘Windy Brook.’ The top of the car falls on the street. Why did Joanna become very happy after exiting the car? Don’t think about it. Start a band with Daniel, if his plane doesn’t crash. Romantically pursue Joanna’s sister, Ashley, under the pretense of needing a bass player. Don’t strategize. Just get her number after fourteen days and start a band under the pretense, somehow, of a killing rampage. E-mail, phone-number, marriage. Martial arts, deer, nothingness. A band can make Paul happy. Every song will be depressing, which will make Paul happy. It is not impossible to be happy. One song will be about U-turns. ‘Allegorical.’ ‘Profound.’ When Daniel comes back from Seattle they will start a band. They’ll ‘screw around’ for two hours then feel depressed and go to Denny’s. (“Remember when my mom died?”) They’ll ‘jam’ for ten minutes and feel bored, and fucked. The word ‘jam’ embarrasses Paul a little. ‘Screw around.’ Paul needs to go back to Denny’s and apologize. He’ll throw a wad of cash at the doomed waitress then apologize sincerely. He will not overturn a table. He’ll blame Daniel. Daniel will go to jail. Use fake names. Thomas ran away, not me. I got caught up in the moment. Use clichés of language and fake names; give the cash in a manila envelope, smile contritely, apologize sincerely, use one or two clichés of language. Gotta run, don’t spend it all in one place. It’s 9 p.m. Do it tonight? Paul is better, as a person, at night. In daylight he feels like a bad actor in an independent movie, about to go on a melodramatic killing spree.At home Paul writes “Sorry” on an envelope. Below that, “For Real.” On another envelope he writes “Really Sorry” and puts two twenties in. Sounds sarcastic. On another, “Sincerely Sorry,” moves the twenties. The alliteration is too commercial. Writes “Sorry.” Moves the twenties. Paul feels sorry for the twenties. At least they are a pair. The twenties are in love. Paul is jealous.[DRIVEWAY] at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "D: DRIVEWAY",
    "text": "D: DRIVEWAY Thursday, November 22, 2018 DRIVEWAY I’m home from work. It’s 2 a.m. or something. I’ve been watching movies on television. It’s very dark out. I’m walking through the house. My mom’s asleep. My brother’s asleep. Our house is big. I try not to make any noise. All the lights are off. The dogs are sleeping too. There’s a night-light by the stairs. It’s on. I sleep upstairs in the room above the garage. It’s quiet. I don’t want to wake anyone. I don’t make any noise as I go up the stairs. It’s very dark. My door is closed. I open it.I can’t sleep. I’m lying on my bed. I’m thinking how there’s no way out of anything. The pillow is too hard. I’m looking at the clock across the room on the computer desk. Its green numbers change to 4:25. I stand beside my bed. It’s dark. My body is exposed. There are three windows to this room. I don’t know if something will come at me. All this dark area on my chest and legs that I can’t see if anything’s there. I run a little to the light. My heart is beating very fast. I turn on the light and turn around. There is nothing in my room. Besides my bed and all that stuff. The ceiling fan is not on. On the ground are lingerie catalogues from earlier.It’s around 4:45 a.m. I’m looking out the window at the reservoir across the street. I’m looking at the moon, up and to the right. It’s a stone, glowing, drifting away. I look for clouds. I see stars. A plane. The street is somewhat lit. There are streetlamps. I’ve been home from New York City three months. There is still the summer ahead, like a beach or parking lot. It’s 5:10 and I’m at the other window, which overlooks the driveway. I’m putting my head out the window. I twist my torso out and I sit, facing my room, on the sill. There’s the roof out here. I can climb up maybe. I’m standing on the sill, holding the top corners of the window. I’m trying to reach the ledge of the roof. I can’t sleep. I need to be on the roof. I’m moving my foot to the side frame of the window to try and leverage myself up. I’m almost there. I have two fingers touching a shingle of the roof. The shingles are like a dog’s tongue. I’m falling. I’m trying to use my hands to pull my head and neck and body up, but there’s only air. The top of my head hits the driveway. It makes a noise like an egg cracking.The sun’s coming up somewhere. I can see the ceiling of my room from here. The lights are on inside. I didn’t turn them off. I’m in pain. I think what hurts is my head. I can’t move my legs. I think I can move my hands but I’m not sure. They feel numb. But if they feel numb that means I can feel them. I don’t know what this means. I hear a car on the road. Birds are chirping. I’m on the driveway. Something walks by on my left. A lizard. What hurts most is a patch on the top of my head. I can feel the hairs sticking out like toothpicks. My blood feels warm. I imagine a dark red pool around my head.I hear silverware in the house. The dogs are barking. Someone opens the window by the front door. My brother says something. He says the word omelet. The television is on. It’s CNN. I think I feel a little hungry. My contact lenses are getting dry. I close my eyes. I see a dark orange light. The sun is steep behind my head. I feel tired. It feels like there are large grapes inside of my eyeballs. I’m falling asleep. The driveway is very hard. It feels good.I wake to a rumbling noise. I don’t know where I am. I’m thinking there are classes to go to. Is there a Chinese test today? Is it Monday? I see the sky and some of a house. I remember I’m at home. But what room? There’s a cloud above that looks like a steak. I remember falling from the window. The rumbling noise is a car. I can’t raise my head to see what’s coming. I see a blue curve of my mom’s minivan coming out of the garage. It’s coming very close to me. It’s going to run over my legs. I feel a pull in my neck, at the back of my scalp, by my left ear. My body moves a little. The minivan goes into the street. I listen until it’s gone. Everything is very quiet. I wonder about my leg.I remember how I was watching The Rules of Attraction on TV last night. I was doing sit-ups on the carpet. I did push-ups with my back straight and my head up, like the Sphinx. I was drinking green tea and eating purple grapes. I wonder where I’ll be in ten hours. Ten days. A year. I’m thinking this isn’t so bad. Forty or sixty more years. Then it’s over. There are hours like this, like parts of a day, and then there are years. Things can pass. They can go by quietly when you aren’t doing anything. Nothing can happen. It’s okay. It’s not so bad.I see a body in the window of my room. The body is blurry. My contact lenses are dry again. I wonder if they’ll slide to the backs of my eyeballs. I hear my brother’s voice. It says, Shit, Mom. His voice sounds very quiet but I know he is shouting. I try to say something. I feel a small pressure in the back of my throat. I don’t really hurt anymore. I can’t feel anything. I wonder about this. If I can’t feel anything am I paralyzed? If I’m paralyzed how can I feel that I’m not feeling anything? Mom, says my brother. I’m trying to concentrate on the part of myself where there’s the feeling of not being able to feel. I can’t focus anywhere. It feels like the sky is pressing out from my insides. There’s just a numbness everywhere. I think I can feel the driveway, like another leg or body, another unfeeling part of me. at November 22, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Older Post Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "2: STAND THERE",
    "text": "2: STAND THERE Tuesday, November 20, 2018 STAND THERE Standing quietly in the elevator, Paul thought of how Michelle had recently “developed a habit” of meeting him late for things, either by 10-20 minutes or, on a few occasions, by an exact hour, always giving the explanation that she had forgotten whether it was at x o’clock or x+1 o’clock and must have misremembered it as having to leave at x o’clock. He vaguely remembered how Michelle had said that things would change from now on, that she wouldn’t be late anymore. Earlier, Paul's train had arrived 8:40 at 23rd St, where he waited for Michelle until she came running up to meet him at 8:59.  “Come outside a minute, I have to tell you something.”Outside, Michelle smiled at him, and then Paul wasn’t sure, but he said it anyway: “If a terrorist said to you that if you were late he’d kill you and your family, would you be one minute early? You wouldn’t; you’d be half the fucking day early.” He had rehearsed in his head.“What the hell are you saying, Paul?” said Michelle. “Are you kidding me? Don’t do this. You don’t know what you’re talking about.”But there were things that you had to worry about, Paul knew, that you had to care about. If he didn’t say anything, then she would be 20 minutes late, then an hour, then she wouldn’t show up at all. Or she’d show up and throw a pie in his face. You had to keep your life under control. Preempt it. You had to let it know that you were not happy. Though maybe you didn’t. Maybe it was that you should let things go, be tolerant and easy-going and not ever worry. Ease yourself towards acceptance and quietude, towards, what though—death? No; that didn’t seem right. You were supposed to resist death.“Yeah I do,” Paul said. “I’m talking about you shouldn’t be late all the time. It’s inconsiderate.”“Will you realize what you’re saying right now? I was early this time.”“I know, but you ran,” Paul said. “You could have easily been late.”“So what? I was early.”They stood there for a long time. All the moody emptinesses inside of them swelled and joined, and then ensconced them, like bubbles, and there, inside, they floated—the qualmish, smoked-out bodies of them, stale and still and upside-down. People around them drifted in and out of cars, into stores, across streets and over sidewalks.“You should have been twenty minutes early,” Paul finally said. “You should have thought, ‘Hmm, I’ve been late so many times, maybe I should come much earlier this time, in case one of my excuses comes up to delay me.’ ”“You should have been an hour early,”—once he started, he knew, he had to keep going; the anger came from nowhere, it came and was here—“sitting and waiting, to make up for all the hundreds of hours you’ve been late before, to compensate, to make sure.” The city lights overlapped in the air, became swimmy, blotchy, and brown. What was reasonable and what was required and what was just plain stupid? Should he apologize? All of life seemed just to be one thing—one slap-dash’ed, stuffed turkey of a thing, flying out of the oven and into the night, into orbit; something once familiar and under control, but now just out there, unknown, by itself, charred and brainless and rarely glimpsed.“That’s it,” Michelle said. “I’m going to your place right now to get my stuff.”They went back to Paul’s apartment. They walked the entire way. Across the avenues and over the Brooklyn bridge. She walked about 20 feet in front. He followed. The night was noisy and black, starless and warm. Maybe it was not winter at all, but summer.At his apartment, Paul sat on his bed.Michelle smashed her possessions into her piece of luggage. “You can keep these for your next girlfriend.” She held up two mud-green three-pound weights.“Can you be quiet a little? My suitemate is probably trying to sleep,” Paul said. “Why are you so angry, anyway? You’re leaving me, so calm down.”Michelle’s mouth began to bleed, a slow seeping at the edge, like an early sign of mutation. Her cheek had been swollen for too long. There was maybe something wrong with the stitches. “Fuck,” she said. “You didn’t even come with me for my wisdom teeth.” She wiped her mouth with one of Paul’s shirts. “You had to go to class?—you skip all your fucking classes!”“That’s my shirt,” Paul said. “That’s inconsiderate.” Against the bureau was a stack of photos that they had taken together. “Take your photos,” Paul said. Michelle kicked them across the floor. She threw her sandals against the wall. They lodged in the window blinds and dust went in the air.“Why are you acting like this?” Paul said.Michelle set her luggage upright, the wheels aimed at the door. “Why don’t you install soundproof walls for your suitemate?” she said. “If you care about her so much, why don’t you?”“I will,” Paul said. “That’s considerate of you, finally.” They looked at each other. Blood oozed again out of Michelle’s mouth, and then out her nose, like a crushed thought. She went and grabbed her sandals from the blinds. She set her luggage outside the door, got in position to properly slam the door with both hands, and then slammed it. The door bounced off its frame without closing.Michelle wheeled her luggage down the outside hall. It made squeaky noises, and train track noises. Paul sat and listened. For a moment he felt sorry for her, for himself, for the whole wrecked and blighting world—it was hopeless, really—but then he felt okay, felt that things were not that bad; he felt friendly, and he felt that this moment of softness, of calm, though maybe it was just that he was tired, was good, was enough, that if there could be this feeling, then things would go on, month after month, one good and tiny feeling per; it was okay. And he wanted suddenly, badly, to share all this, and so he called out, “Have a good week.” He stood and shouted, “Wait; I hope you can be happy now; I hope we can be friends still, really,” and then Michelle was back, was looking, was saying, “You’re a real shithead,” was saying some other things, her face inflamed, and the door, then, slamming shut, making a loud noise.[GO TO BED AND SLEEP][GO TO TAIPEI] at November 20, 2018 Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Home Report Abuse"

    "title": "gtbas: GO TO BED AND SLEEP",
    "text": "gtbas: GO TO BED AND SLEEP Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO TO BED AND SLEEP Something staticky and paranormally ventilated about the air, which drifted through a half-open window, late one afternoon, caused a delicately waking Paul, clutching a pillow and drooling a little, to believe he was a small child in Florida, in a medium-size house, on or near winter break. He felt dimly excited, anticipating a hyperactive movement of his body into a standing position, then was mostly unconscious for a vague amount of time until becoming aware of what seemed to be a baffling non sequitur—and, briefly, in its mysterious approach from some eerie distance, like someone else’s consciousness—before resolving plainly as a memory, of having already left Florida, at some point, to attend New York University. After a deadpan pause, during which the new information was accepted by default as recent, he casually believed it was autumn and he was in college, and as he felt that period’s particular gloominess he sensed a concurrent assembling, at a specific distance inside himself, of dozens of once-intimate images, people, places, situations. With a sensation of easily and entirely abandoning a prior context, of having no memory, he focused, as an intrigued observer, on this assembling and was surprised by an urge, which he immediately knew he hadn’t felt in months, or maybe years, to physically involve himself—by going outside and living each day patiently—in the ongoing, concrete occurrence of what he was passively, slowly remembering. But the emotion dispersed to a kind of nothingness—and its associated memories, like organs in a lifeless body, became rapidly indiscernible, dissembling by the metaphysical equivalent, if there was one, of entropy—as he realized, with some confusion and an oddly instinctual reluctance, blinking and discerning his new room, which after two months could still seem unfamiliar, that he was somewhere else, as a different person, in a much later year.He kept his eyes pressurelessly closed and didn’t move, wanting to return—without yet knowing who or what he was—to sleep, where he could intensify and prolong and explore what he residually felt and was uncontrollably forgetting, but was already alert, in concrete reality, to a degree that his stillness, on his queen-size mattress, felt like a kind of hiding. He stared at the backs of his eyelids with motionless eyeballs, slightly feigning not knowing what he was looking at—which also felt like a kind of hiding—and gradually discerned that he was in Brooklyn, on an aberrantly colder day in late March, in the two-person apartment, in a four-story house, where he had moved because Kyle and Gabby had wanted more space, to “save their relationship.”It was spring, not winter or autumn, Paul thought with some lingering confusion. He listened to the layered murmur of wind against leaves, familiarly and gently disorienting as a terrestrial sound track, reminding people of their own lives, then opened his MacBook—sideways, like a hardcover book—and looked at the internet, lying on his side, with his right ear pressed into his pillow, as if, unable to return to sleep, at least in position to hear what, in his absence, might be happening there.

    "title": "gtbas: GO TO THE LIBRARY",
    "text": "gtbas: GO TO THE LIBRARY Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO TO THE LIBRARY That night—after leaving his room at dusk, then “working on things” in an underground computer lab in Bobst Library, as he did most days—Paul became “completely lost,” he repeatedly thought, in a tundra-like area of Brooklyn for around twenty minutes before unexpectedly arriving at the arts space hosting the panel discussion, on the topic of self-publishing, he’d agreed to attend with his literary acquaintance Anton, 23, who was visiting from Norway. Paul began, at some point, during the ninety-minute discussion, to feel a mocking, sitcom-like conviction that, for him, “too many years had passed” since college—that without education’s season-backed, elaborately subdivided, continuous structure, traceable numerically backward almost to birth, connecting a life in that direction, he was becoming isolated and unexplainable as one of those mysterious phenomena, contained within informational boxes, in picture-heavy books on natural history, which he would’ve felt scared, as a child, if he was alone in a dark room, to think about for too long. After the ninety-minute discussion, which seemed unanimously in favor of self-publishing, the audience was instructed, somewhat anticlimactically, to bring their folding chairs to another room and lean them against a wall, then Paul and Anton stood waiting for Juan, 24, an MFA student in fiction at NYU, who’d wanted to eat with them but was talking to an attractive woman.“What should we do?” said Paul.“I don’t know,” said Anton in a quiet monotone.They decided to leave in three minutes, at 9:01. This was Paul’s second or third social situation involving more than one person, excluding himself, since his relationship with Michelle ended one and a half months ago, his only regular communication were email and Gmail chats with Charles, 25, who lived in Seattle with his girlfriend and who had sold most of his belongings, the past few months, in preparation to leave America indefinitely to travel alone in Mexico—and eventually South America—because he felt “alienated,” he’d said.“It’s 9:04,” said Anton.“What should we do?”“We could wait until 9:10.”“I don’t know,” said Paul grinning. “I don’t know. Let’s just leave now, I think.” He didn’t move for around ten seconds. “We should go,” he said, and after a few seconds moved toward the exit, feeling slightly oxygen deprived.“Hey,” said Juan running. “Are you guys going to eat now?”“Yeah,” said Paul, and glanced, for some reason, at Anton, whose eyes, behind medium-thick lenses, appeared farther away but of higher resolution than the rest of his face.“Sorry,” said Juan looking at Anton.“It’s called Pacifico,” said Paul outside. “The address is 97 Smith.”“I think Pacific is this way,” said Juan.“Pacifico,” said Paul looking at Anton, who seemed to be grinning.“This way,” said Juan rolling his bike beside him.“Wait,” said Paul. “The restaurant is called Pacifico.”“I kept thinking it was on Pacific,” said Juan with a serious expression.“No,” said Paul. “But it’s probably near Pacific.”In Pacifico, a dungeon-like Mexican restaurant, Paul stared at his menu, waiting for his eyes to adjust in the diffuse lighting. He was aware of Anton and Juan, across the table, also holding and staring at menus. When their burritos arrived he noticed, with preemptively suppressed interpretation, that his, of the three, appeared slightly darkest. Then a large group of males from the panel discussion entered and seated themselves in a swarming and disorganized manner, which Paul experienced as a parody of surrounding a heterosexual, single male with a variety of ethnicities and ages of males.While idly eating the salad-y remains of his burrito with a fork, around twenty minutes later, Paul became aware of himself analyzing when he should’ve left. He vaguely traced back the night and concluded he should’ve left when, on his way to the venue, he had been “completely lost.” He allowed himself to consider earlier opportunities, mostly for something to do, and discerned after a brief sensation of helplessness—like if he’d divided 900 by itself and wanted the calculator to answer 494/494 or 63/63—that, in terms of leaving this social situation, he shouldn’t have been born. He suppressed a grin, then channeled the impulse into the formation of what he thought of as a nervous smile and stood and mumbled “I’m going to sleep now” and “nice seeing you” until he was outside, where it was windy and cold.He walked toward an F train station, aware of the strangeness of clouds at night—their enveloped flatness and dimensional vagueness, shifting and osmotic as some advanced form of gaseous amoeba—and remembered when he got lodged in an upside-down wood stool, as a small child, in Florida. His father had sawed off two rungs with an enormous, floppy, serrated blade while his mother, alternately grinning and intensely focused, careful not to allow her personal experience of the event impair its documentation, photographed them from different angles, sometimes directing their attention to the camera, like in a photo shoot.Paul felt more committed, after that, to viewing the time until September as an \"interim\" period, and didn’t have an in-person conversation for more than a week, during which, to his own approval, he seemed to be settling, if precariously, with two days spent mostly eating, into a somewhat productive, loneliness-free routine. He remembered while peeling a banana one night that he had committed, months ago, to a reading in April—in three days, he learned from the internet, in a building near Times Square.[GO TO READING] Posted by Nate at 6:21 AM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "gtbas: GO TO READING",
    "text": "gtbas: GO TO READING Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO TO READING At the reading, after arriving ten minutes early by accident and talking to the organizer, then sitting alone and, to appear occupied, holding a pen and staring down at what he’d printed in the library—an account of a trip to Germany, fourteen months ago—where he planned to return immediately after he and Frederick, an author in his early 40s, finished reading, Paul began to feel sleepy, in his seat. Yawning, he looked  up and recognized Mitch, 26, a classmate from middle/ high school in Florida, where they had mutual friends but had never spoken to each other, that Paul could remember, approaching from a conspiratorially far distance, like an FBI agent but slower. Mitch had messaged on Facebook, a few weeks ago, that he might attend this reading.“You look the same. What about me?”“Taller,” said Mitch seeming a little nervous.“How can you tell? I’m sitting.”“The shape of your legs, and your body, I think. Something about your bone structure.”After the reading Lucie, 23, introduced herself and Amy, 23, and Daniel, 25, to Paul and Mitch, saying something about her and Amy’s online magazine. Paul asked if they had business cards, not thinking they would. Amy, after encouragement from Lucie, reluctantly gave Paul a business card, seeming a little embarrassed. When Paul looked up from the business card, putting it in his back pocket, he was startled by the sudden appearance of Frederick smiling at him with his arm around Lucie in a manner that seemed calculated, but wasn’t, Paul knew, to firmly establish they were “together.” A bewildered-seeming, middle-aged woman with an Italian accent asked Paul something about agave nectar, wanting it for a diabetic friend, it seemed. Paul said he’d actually learned, a few months ago, that it raised blood sugar as intensely as sugar and that he’d mailed his mother unheated, unfiltered honey, which was the healthiest sweetener—for diabetics, or anyone—based on what he currently knew, which could be wrong, he also knew.In a taxi to a party, forty minutes later, Paul imagined another him walking toward the library and, for a few seconds, visualizing the position and movement of two red dots through a silhouetted, aerial view of Manhattan, felt as imaginary, as mysterious and transitory and unfindable, as the other dot. He visualized the vibrating, squiggling, looping, arcing line representing the three-dimensional movement, plotted in a cubic grid, of the dot of himself, accounting for the different speed and direction of each vessel of which he was a passenger—taxi, Earth, solar system, Milky Way, etc. Adding a fourth dimension, representing time, he visualized the patterned scribbling shooting off in one direction, with a slight wobble, miles from where it was seconds ago. He imagined his trajectory as a vacuum-sealed tube, into which he’d arrived and through which—traveling alone in the vacuum-sealed tube of his own life—he’d be suctioned and from which he’d exit, as a successful delivery to some unimaginable recipient. Realizing this was only his concrete history, his public movement through space-time from birth to death, he briefly imagined being able to click on his trajectory to access his private experience, enlarging the dot of a coordinate until it could be explored like a planet.

    "title": "ER: GO PARTY",
    "text": "ER: GO PARTY Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO PARTY At the party, which was mostly people in their 30s and 40s, Paul asked Amy an open-ended question about her parents. When she began, after a pause, to answer, he moved his phone from his pants pocket to his ear. “Hello,” he said in a clear voice, and felt physically isolated, like he was wearing a motorcycle helmet, as he peripherally observed Amy moving her wine, almost spilling it, to her mouth.“Just kidding,” said Paul. “No one called me.”Amy had a glassy, disoriented expression.“I don’t have a phone call,” said Paul.“That was good,” said Amy looking away.“Just kidding,” said Paul grinning weakly.The rest of the party, after briefly talking to Lucie, who invited him and Mitch to a party next week at her apartment, Paul talked mostly to Daniel, who had enough money from  selling marijuana in San Francisco that he hadn’t had a job since moving here last autumn. Paul asked if Daniel liked drugs. Daniel said he liked “benzos” and opiates. Paul asked if he liked Rilo Kiley and he became quiet a few seconds, seeming worried, like he might not be able to answer, before saying “um, not really.”Paul went with Daniel, the next night, to a BBQ-themed party, where their main focus, soon after arriving, was on discerning how to leave tactfully, considering how much food they’d eaten and how little they were contributing to conversation, for a party at Kyle and Gabby’s apartment. Standing in a kitchen, at one point, while Daniel was outside smoking, Paul felt like a shark whose eyes have protectively “glossed over” during a feeding frenzy, as he mechanically ate salad, cheese, a burger, apple pie, chips while vaguely focused on not doing anything to cause others to talk to him.At Kyle and Gabby’s apartment—his first time back since moving out—Paul uncharacteristically approached an intriguing, attractive stranger named Laura and asked her questions with a serious expression, standing at a maybe too-close distance, as if after an unskillful teleportation he didn’t want to underscore by fixing. Laura was here with her friend Walter, who knew Gabby. Paul could see that Laura, who wasn’t looking at him, didn’t like his presence and was getting annoyed, but due to alcohol he felt unaffected by this information and kept asking questions, including her age and what college, if any, she attended, or had attended. As Laura’s annoyance intensified to a slightly curious disbelief she became extra alert—focusing exclusively on Paul with a challenging, vigilante expression. She asked why he was asking so many questions.“I’m not. I’m just trying to talk.”“Why are you interrogating me?”“I’m just trying to have a conversation.”“What college did you go to?” said Laura accusatorily.“New York University. How old are you?”Laura walked away, somewhat aimlessly, into the room Paul crawled across the first time he saw Michelle cry—around a year ago, he realized. In the room now was a king-size bed, which occupied maybe 80 percent of its surface. Paul was sitting alone, at the snack table, thirty minutes later, when Laura approached with a bored expression, unaware of his presence until he stood and said “I highly recommend the Funyuns” in an exaggeratedly helpful voice, choosing Funyuns—corn in the shape and flavor of fried rings of onion—somewhat randomly from the eight to twelve snacks on the table.“Oh, really?” said Laura reciprocating his tone.“Let me help you,” said Paul lifting the giant plastic red bowl toward Laura, who chose and bit a piece, then moved backward a little, with a playful expression, nodding and smiling, before turning around and walking away, reappearing around twenty minutes later at a near distance, moving directly, as if after a search, toward an inattentive Paul, seated in the same chair as earlier, not apparently doing anything. Before he could say anything about Funyuns, or form any thoughts, Laura had told him her full name, which she wanted him to memorize, quizzing him on it twice—crudely, functionally—before abruptly walking away.Around midnight an aimlessly wandering Gabby, appearing lost in her own kitchen, stopped in front of Daniel and said “you have a nose ring,” with a slightly confused expression to Daniel, who confirmed he did. Gabby, a foot and a half shorter than Daniel, stared up at him a few seconds before saying something that, Paul thought, conveyed she earnestly believed nose rings were objectively bad. She asked where Daniel was from and said “oh, that makes sense, then,” appearing visibly less tense, when Daniel said San Francisco.Paul, staring at Daniel’s left profile, said “I just realized you look like Hugh Jackman.”“He looks like Richard Tuttle,” said Gabby.“I don’t know who that is,” said Daniel.Gabby said Richard Tuttle was a famous artist. Daniel said when he was young his father only brought him to galleries and museums whenever they went anywhere. Paul heard someone say “sculptor.” Someone who didn’t know Daniel drunkenly said “he got the nose ring so people won’t think he’s Hugh Jackman” to Paul at close range. Gabby mentioned another artist Daniel didn’t know and Paul began to sometimes say “you’re too mainstream for us” in a loud, sarcastic voice while staring at Gabby—thinking that, by underscoring that he and Daniel were obviously too mainstream for her, he was sincerely complimenting her knowledge of the art world—who ignored him easily, with no indication of any awareness of his presence. When Gabby finally looked at him, seeming more confused than agitated, Paul sarcastically sustained a huge grin, which Gabby stared at blankly while appearing to be thinking, very slowly, due to alcohol, about what, if anything, she should do about what was happening. After around five seconds she walked away with a slight, momentary wobble. Kyle appeared around fifteen minutes later and said “leave” to Daniel, who was grinning about something else.“Huh?” said Daniel.“Leave,” said Kyle.“Are you serious?”“Yes,” said Kyle, and Paul realized, with a sensation of low-level epiphany, that Gabby, offended by the nose-ring encounter, must have forced Kyle to tell Daniel to leave. Paul said this aloud a few times, to seemingly no one, then asked why Kyle was “being mean.” Daniel said he would leave after he finished his drink and Kyle said “that’s fine” and walked away.“Jesus,” said Paul. “Gabby hates nose rings.”“I didn’t think she was angry when we talked,” said Daniel.“You’re probably benefiting this party the most out of anyone,” said Paul. “You’re standing in one place, occasionally saying something witty, causing people passing by to laugh. You’re not even eating anything.”“I planned to go to another party anyway,” said Daniel.Almost half the party, thirty minutes later, was on the wide sidewalk outside the apartment building, grinning drunk-enly or looking at one another with openly bored or neutral expressions, waiting for directions to the other party. Paul, who was grinning uncontrollably, had approached groups of acquaintances asking if they wanted to go to a different party while a cheerful-seeming Daniel, standing in place in the kitchen, sometimes assumed the role of an unruly tyrant, saying things like “get every single person” and “we aren’t leaving until you get every person.” Paul had wanted to tell Daniel he shouldn’t want so much from life but couldn’t remember the stock phrase for “don’t want too much in life” and, after a long pause, had said “you shouldn’t want so much in life.” Mitch had repeatedly held shots of tequila toward Paul, who drank two and, at one point, entered the small room where  Kyle and Gabby slept and interrupted Gabby and Jeremy and Juan by asking if “anyone” wanted to go to “a different party,” aware he was unaffected, due to alcohol, by Gabby’s presence.Someone said it probably wasn’t a good idea to stand “in a giant mass blocking the entire sidewalk” in front of the party they’d just abandoned, and the group of twelve to fifteen people began walking in a direction, led vaguely by Daniel, who was talking into his phone. After around ten blocks Daniel moved his phone away from his head and told Paul—and three or four other people within range—that they’d walked in the wrong direction. Paul said someone needed to make an announcement because the group, which wasn’t stopping, was too large for information to spread naturally to itself. “We walked the wrong way,” shouted Mitch. “Stop walking. We walked the wrong way.”Paul went with Daniel and Mitch to the other party, which they found after around forty minutes, when everyone else had gone home, to bars, or sheepishly back to Kyle and Gabby’s party.[ADD DANIEL ON FACEBOOK][ADD LAURA ON FACEBOOK] Posted by Nate at 6:31 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Home"

    "title": "ER: ADD DANIEL ON FACEBOOK",
    "text": "ER: ADD DANIEL ON FACEBOOK Tuesday, November 20, 2018 ADD DANIEL ON FACEBOOK The next night Paul was with Mitch and Matt—another classmate from Florida, one year ahead of Mitch and Paul, currently “on vacation” alone—at Barcade, a bar with dozens of arcade machines. Matt’s friend Lindsay (whom he was staying with while on vacation) arrived and everyone walked six blocks to a bar with outdoor Ping-Pong tables. Daniel arrived with his friend Fran, 22, whose intriguing gaze, Paul noticed with interest, seemed both disbelieving and transfixed in discernment, as if meticulously studying what she knew she was hallucinating. Paul looked at his phone and was staring at its screen for ten to twenty seconds without thinking when he heard Daniel say “a Mexican place” and something about “six tacos” to Mitch.“Eight tacos,” said Paul absently.“I said six tacos,” said Daniel.“Six tacos,” said Paul. “Was it, like . . . a taco platter?”“No. This place has small tacos.”“It wasn’t a taco platter?”“It wasn’t a taco platter,” said Daniel.“I don’t get it,” said Paul without thinking.“Bro,” said Daniel grinning.Paul asked Fran what she had eaten.“Enchiladas,” said Fran.“I can never remember what those are,” said Paul, and went to the bathroom. When he returned Lindsay invited everyone to her Cinco de Mayo party—in five days, at her apartment—then everyone, except Fran, who Daniel said was an undergrad at Columbia and had left to do homework, walked eight blocks to a bar called Harefield Road to meet a group of people Paul knew as acquaintances from his involvement in poetry. Seconds after sitting in the outdoor  area Paul openly said “I want to comfort myself with food” without looking at anyone, in a relatively loud voice, with a bleak sensation of unsatisfying catharsis from having accurately, he felt, expressed himself. “I’m just going to eat whatever tonight,” he said, and stood, asking if anyone knew about food options at this bar. Two acquaintances said there were, at this time, around 2:30 a.m., only paninis. One of Daniel’s two suitemates, who said she’d written an article about Paul and reviewed books anonymously for Kirkus, went with him to order a panini. Paul asked if she liked a baseball book, which she mentioned having reviewed, and she talked without pause for what seemed like ten minutes, during which Paul, staring at her calmly, thought “she’s definitely drunk” and “she seems maybe focused on not appearing drunk, which is maybe affecting her perception of time, of how long and off-topic and incomprehensible her answer has become.” Paul carried his panini outside and “openly exchanged witty banter while feeling severely depressed,” he thought while speaking to various acquaintances. One said she’d met Paul, when he lived with Shawn Olive, at least three times. Paul said he didn’t recognize her, but also had forgotten that he’d once lived with Shawn Olive. He ate half his panini and said it was unsatisfying and left the bar and returned with Tate’s cookies and Fig Newmans, which he offered to each person. He asked Lindsay what her roommate, whom she’d been talking about, was doing. Lindsay said “sleeping, watching TV, or smoking weed” and Paul said “we should go to your apartment,” aware he was somewhat desperately, if maybe sarcastically, trying to direct his interest toward any girl he had not yet, but still could, meet tonight.“This bar’s special feature: ‘paninis until really late,’ ” said Paul to a drunk-looking acquaintance on the way out.• • •In Lindsay’s apartment’s common room Paul sat eating Fig Newmans on one side of a five-seat sofa with Mitch and Daniel on the other side. Lindsay’s roommate was sleeping. Paul was vaguely aware, as he reread old texts from Michelle, of people pressuring Matt to smoke marijuana. Matt was standing alone in a corner of the room—seeming in Paul’s peripheral vision like a figure in a horror movie—saying things, as explanation for his choice not to smoke marijuana, about his grandfather’s alcoholism. Paul half-unconsciously mumbled something—to himself, he felt—about feeling thirsty and within a few seconds Matt was standing above him asking if he wanted water. After bringing him a glass of water Matt asked if Paul wanted to use his MacBook to look at the internet. Paul felt endeared to a degree that—in combination with his emotional state, and as he dwelled a few seconds on how Matt’s behavior was like the opposite of pressuring someone to smoke marijuana—he felt like crying. Matt returned with a large MacBook from the room he was sleeping in while on vacation.“Thank you,” said Paul smiling.“You’re very welcome,” said Matt.“You’re being really nice to me.”“You’re the guest here,” said Matt, and Paul gingerly asked if he “by chance” had an iPod cord, sensing he would enjoy further indulging an appreciative subject with his gratuitous helpfulness. Paul accepted Matt’s iPod cord with a sensation, he felt, of daintiness, which remained as he transferred mostly pop-punk songs from Matt’s MacBook to his iPod nano. Around 4:30 a.m., in his room, Paul bit a piece of a 150mg Seroquel and listened to songs he hadn’t heard since high school, mostly the EP Look Forward to Failure by the Ataris. He woke at night fifteen hours later and, while showering, felt like he lived in a module attached to a spaceship far enough from any star to never experience daylight.[CINCO DE MAYO] Posted by Nate at 6:36 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "ER: CINCO DE MAYO",
    "text": "ER: CINCO DE MAYO Tuesday, November 20, 2018 CINCO DE MAYO Three days later Paul exited the Graham L train station carrying beer and guacamole ingredients in a paper bag from Whole Foods for Lindsay’s Cinco de Mayo party. Sitting cross-legged on the sidewalk against a Thai restaurant was a girl with dyed-black hair. As Paul approached she looked up knowingly with an innocent, wary gaze.“Hi,” said Paul. “Are you Fran?”“Yeah,” said Fran.“I’m Paul.”“I know,” said Fran, and slowly closed her notebook.“Are you doing homework?”“My friend’s homework.”“Nice,” said Paul staring transfixed at Fran’s delicate and extreme gaze, like that of a skeleton with eyeballs, or a person with their face peeled off. Paul began talking—slowly, before accelerating to a normal speed—about how Daniel had sounded “really drunk” on the phone but had sent witty, insightful, elaborate texts of mostly long, elegant sentences. Fran said Daniel was like that when on Klonopin. Paul asked if he could have a Klonopin and Fran gave him one and looked to his left, where he was surprised to see Daniel standing in place, a few feet away, looking at Fran with the fixed, discerning, earnest gaze of a three-year-old processing information without considering utility or personal relevance. Paul asked Daniel how many Klonopin he had taken.“Five,” said Daniel.“Jesus,” said Paul.• • •When Paul entered the party, ahead of Daniel and Fran, Lindsay wreathed a plastic snake around his head and pulled him toward a hallway designated for photographs. Paul mumbled the word “bathroom” and walked away grinning into the kitchen, where Matt was standing alone, not apparently doing anything. Paul asked about his vacation. Matt said he drove a rental car without a plan to Maine and ate seafood in a restaurant alone, did other things alone. “It was really good,” he said, and briefly displayed a haunted and irreducibly unenthusiastic expression before reaching for chips. Paul walked out of the kitchen and looked at Fran sitting alone on the sofa where he’d eaten Fig Newmans five days ago and returned to the kitchen and, while peripherally aware of a self-conscious Matt slowly creating guacamole, asked Daniel what he’d meant—in one of his dense, interesting texts—when he said he felt like there’d been “strange occurrences lately.” Daniel said he read all of Paul’s books last autumn while in San Francisco and told his friends he had a feeling that when he came to New York City he would meet Paul and they would become friends. Daniel was alert and expressionless as an advanced cyborg as he explained that he’d gone to Paul and Frederick’s reading because Amy didn’t want to be alone with Lucie and that none of them had known Paul was reading.“I’ve felt similar things,” said Paul. “Since Kyle’s party, when I met Laura. Or, I mean, actually, the night before that, at the reading near Times Square, when we met.”“How do you feel about it?”“About what?”“It,” said Daniel vaguely.“It seems good. New things keep happening, which seems good. I just felt right now like it’s going to end tonight.”“You’re pessimistic about it,” said Daniel as a neutral observation, staring intensely at Paul with a serious, almost grim expression.“We haven’t referenced it until now.”“I’m sorry for talking about it and causing you to think it might end,” said Daniel earnestly.“It’s okay,” said Paul, a little confused. “Maybe it won’t end. But I wonder if we need to make an effort, for it to continue.”“Well,” said Daniel hesitantly. “Don’t you think it just needs to happen naturally?”“Yeah,” said Paul.“Well, then we wouldn’t make an effort, then, huh?”“I mean if we need to keep doing things, instead of staying inside,” said Paul.“You said you only go to like one party a month. But you’re at almost every party.”“This isn’t normal at all,” said Paul. “Before we met I probably did less than one thing a month.”“Why do you think that is?”“Probably because I met people I like.”Daniel hesitated. “What people?”“You, Mitch, . . . Amy,” said Paul. “I’m going to the bathroom.” When he returned Fran and Daniel were making guacamole energetically, with spoons and a mashing strategy, adding onion and cilantro and salsa and garlic powder, having apparently replaced Matt, who was very slowly, it seemed, moving a beer toward his mouth. Paul began eating guacamole as it was being made, with chips, to no discernible opposition. In a distracted voice, without looking at anyone, he asked if Daniel and Fran wanted to go to a “book party” tomorrow night at a bookstore in Greenpoint and they seemed interested. Fran gave everyone vodka shots. Matt moved into a position facing more people and, with an earnest but powerless attempt at enthusiasm, resulting in a  a weak form of sarcasm, asked if everyone wanted to go to the roof.On the fourth-story roof Paul said he wanted to run “really fast in a circle,” vaguely aware and mostly unconcerned, though he knew he didn’t want to die—less because he had an urge to live than because dying, like knitting or backgammon, seemed irrelevant to his life—that due to alcohol and Klonopin, in a moment of inattention, he could easily walk off the building. He collided with an unseen Fran—who seemed already confused, before this, standing alone in an arbitrary area of the roof—and felt intrigued by the binary manner that his movement was stopped, though how else, he vaguely realized, could something stop? He went downstairs and indiscriminately moved refried beans, guacamole, three kinds of chips, cucumber, salsa, beef onto his plate until he had a roughly symmetrical mound of food, on top of which—on the way out of the kitchen, as a kind of afterthought—he added a fluffy, triangular wedge of cake. After carrying the Mayan-pyramid-shaped plate of food, with some difficulty, up the ladder, onto the roof, he silently ate it all then said he felt cold and was going inside. He descended the ladder until his head was below the opening to the roof and tried to hear what Fran and Daniel—who remained outside smoking—were saying, while unaware of his presence, but couldn’t, and also didn’t know what could possibly be said that he would want to secretly hear, so returned inside the apartment and lay on his back on the sofa in the common room.He woke to flash photography, then to Lindsay’s voice, in another room, loudly saying “get out.” Lindsay entered  the common room and said, to a blearily waking Paul, something about “your friend” looking inside her purse, trying to steal her shoes. Paul stared blankly, a little embarrassed to have slept on his back, for an unknown amount of time, on the apartment’s only sofa. He looked at his phone: no new texts. After saying “sorry” a few times to Lindsay, who seemed unsure if she felt negatively toward Paul, he put a half-eaten onion, beer bottles, other trash into his Whole Foods bag and descended stairs behind Daniel and Fran, who was quietly murmuring things vaguely in her defense. They decided to go to Legion, a bar, one and a half blocks away, with an outdoor area on the sidewalk.“Were you trying to steal her shoes?” said Daniel.“No, I wasn’t,” said Fran quietly. “Our shoes look the same.”“I’m asking because you’ve told me you like to steal things when you’re drunk.”“I wasn’t stealing her shoes,” said Fran in a loud whisper.They were walking toward Paul’s room, after ten minutes in Legion, when it became known, in a manner that seemed sourceless, as if they realized simultaneously, that Fran had “accidentally,” she then said, stolen a leather jacket, which she was wearing. They agreed it would be inconvenient for the owner to not have their phone, which was in the jacket, but continued walking and each tried on the jacket, which seemed to best fit Paul, who found two gigantic vitamins in one of its pockets. In his room he put the phone on the table beside his mattress and, saying he didn’t want to be near it, sort of pushed it away. He opened his MacBook and played “Annoying Noise of Death” and saw that Daniel was calmly observing himself, in the full-length wall mirror, as he exercised with Caroline’s five-pound weights that were usually on the floor in the kitchen. Fran said to put on Rilo Kiley. Paul said it was Rilo Kiley and, after a few motionless seconds, Fran slowly turned her head away to rotate her face, like a moon orbiting behind its planet, interestingly out of view. Paul grinned to himself as he lay on his back and propped up his head with a folded pillow, resting his MacBook against the front of his thighs, both knees bent. Daniel sat on the mattress in a position that a robot in a black comedy about a child with two fathers, one of whom was a robot, would assume to recite a bedtime story, looking at Paul however with a slightly, stoically puzzled expression. “When you asked me if I liked Rilo Kiley, the night we met, I thought you were joking,” said Daniel.“No,” said Paul. “Why did you think that?”“You’re more earnest than I thought you’d be.”“I wouldn’t joke about something like that.”“Like what?” said Daniel.Paul said he wouldn’t pretend he liked something, or make fun of liking something, or like something “ironically.” Daniel sort of drifted away and began looking at Paul’s books with a patient, scholarly demeanor—in continuation, Paul realized, of a calm inquisitiveness that had characterized most of his behavior tonight, probably due to the five Klonopin he’d ingested, though he was always inquisitive and would continue asking questions, in certain conversations, when others would’ve stopped, which Paul liked. Twenty minutes later Daniel was reading pages of different books and Paul was looking at methadone’s Wikipedia page (“. . . developed in Germany in 1937 . . . an acyclic analog of morphine or heroin . . .”) when Fran returned from outside with cuts on her face and neck from a group of girls, she said, that called her a bitch and said she tried to steal shoes and attacked her, pushing her down. Daniel asked how the girls opened the gate to the house’s walkway. Fran repeated, with a vaguely  confused expression, that she was attacked. Paul, who hadn’t realized she had left the room, asked how she reentered the gate without a key. Fran stared expectantly at Daniel with her child-like gaze, then quietly engaged herself in a solitary activity elsewhere in the room as Daniel and Paul began pondering the situation themselves, to no satisfying conclusion. Fran said she wanted to go dancing at Legion before it closed in less than an hour and Paul thought he saw her put a number of pills into her mouth in the stereotypically indiscriminate manner he’d previously seen only on TV or in movies. Fran and Daniel did yoga-like stretches on Paul’s yoga mat and snorted two Adderall—crushed into a potion-y blue, faintly neon sand—off a pink piece of construction paper. Daniel briefly hugged a supine Paul, then stood at a distance as Fran lay flat on top of Paul with her head facedown to the right of his head. Fran didn’t move for around forty seconds, during which, at one point, she murmured something that seemed significant but, muffled by the mattress, was not comprehensible. She rolled onto her back and Daniel pulled her to a standing position. Paul was surprised to feel moved in a calming, tearful manner—as if some long-term desire, requiring a tiring amount of effort, had been fulfilled—when, before leaving for Legion, both Daniel and Fran affected slightly friendlier demeanors (rounder eyes, higher-pitched voices, a sort of pleasantness of expression like minor face-lifts) to confirm meeting at the book party Paul mentioned earlier and had forgotten.Paul realized after they left that he’d gotten what from elementary school through college he often most wanted—unambiguous indications of secure, mutual friendships—but was no longer important to him.[BOOK PARTY] Posted by Nate at 6:43 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "ER: BOOK PARTY",
    "text": "ER: BOOK PARTY Tuesday, November 20, 2018 BOOK PARTY The book party, like algae, feeling its way elsewhere, moved slowly but persistently from the bookstore’s basement to its  first floor, to the sidewalk outside, converging finally with other groups at a corner bar, where Paul failed more than five times to recognize or remember the faces or names of recent to long-term acquaintances—and twice introduced people he’d already introduced to each other, including Daniel and Frederick, both of whom however either feigned having not met or had actually forgotten—but due to 2mg Klonopin remained poised, with a peaceful sensation of faultlessness, physiologically calm but mentally stimulated, throughout the night, as if beta testing the event by acting like an exaggerated version of himself, for others to practice against, before the real Paul, the only person without practice, was inserted for the actual event. Fran left for her apartment, which she shared with a low-level cocaine dealer majoring in something art related at Columbia, to prepare a kind of pasta, “with a lot of things in it,” that was her specialty, it seemed. Paul and Daniel arrived ninety minutes later and Fran served a giant platter of cheese-covered, lasagna-like pasta—attractively browned in a mottled pattern of variations of crispiness—in small, colorful plastic bowls with buttered toast on which were thin slices of raw garlic. They ate all of it, then arranged themselves on Fran’s three-seat sofa and watched Drugstore Cowboy on Daniel’s MacBook. Paul was unable to discern the movie as coherent—he kept thinking the same scene, in a motel room, was replaying with minor variations—but was aware of sometimes commenting on the sound track, including that it was “really weird” and “unexpected.”Before becoming unconscious Paul was aware of a man wearing a cowboy hat being carried out of a drugstore by four people and of himself thinking that, if the people dragging the man were invisible, the man would look like he was gliding feetfirst on a horizontal waterslide, steadily ahead, with out-of-control limbs and a crazed, antagonistic expression, as if by experimentally self-directed telekinesis.• • •A week later Paul had organized plans to see Trash Humpers and was waiting for Fran and Daniel at the theater. Fran gave Paul six 10mg Adderall for her and Daniel’s tickets and a disoriented-seeming Daniel, who had no money left, asked if Paul had any snacks. Paul gave Daniel a sugar-free Red Bull he got from a Red Bull–shaped car parked outside the library and Daniel drank it in one motion with a neutral expression.“Fran said she’ll pay you back if you give me one of the Adderall she gave you,” whispered Daniel a few minutes into the movie. “I don’t think I can stay awake without it.” In the movie costumed actors made noises in parking lots and inside houses while destroying and/or “humping” inanimate objects. Paul woke, at one point, to Fran laughing loudly when no one else in the small, sold-out theater was laughing. When Paul wasn’t asleep he felt distracted by a feeling that Daniel had eerily turned his head 90 degrees and was staring at him, but each time he looked Daniel was either asleep or looking at the screen. The last ten minutes of the movie Paul was peripherally aware of Daniel’s unsupported head continually lolling in place and twitching to attention in a manner reminiscent of a middle/high school student struggling and repeatedly failing to remain awake in a morning class. Daniel seemed fully alert seconds after the movie ended. Paul asked how he slept despite Adderall and Red Bull.“Susie-Q,” said Daniel with a smirk-like grin indicating both earnest disapproval and a kind of fondness toward Seroquel and its intense, often uncomfortable tranquilizing  effects—as if, believing Susie-Q wasn’t malicious, he could forgive her every time she induced twelve hours of sleep followed by twelve to twenty-four hours of feeling lost and irritable, therefore she functioned, if inadvertently, as a teacher of forgiveness and acceptance and empathy, for which he was grateful.They were the last three people, after the movie, to leave the theater. They stood on the sidewalk, unsure what to do next. Fran had planned to go to Coney Island tonight and stay until morning for her birthday, which was today—she’d created a Facebook listing, which Paul remembered seeing—but none of her friends wanted to go, because she didn’t have any, she said. Paul said he also had no friends and that they should celebrate by “eating a lot of food.”At Lovin’ Cup, a bar-restaurant with live music, Fran and Daniel ordered drinks, went outside to smoke. Paul laid the side of his head on his arms, on the table, and closed his eyes. He didn’t feel connected by a traceable series of linked events to a source that had purposefully conveyed him, from elsewhere, into this world. He felt like a digression that had forgotten from what it digressed and was continuing ahead in a confused, choiceless searching.[GET FOOD] Posted by Nate at 6:46 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "ER: GET FOOD",
    "text": "ER: GET FOOD Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GET FOOD Fran and Daniel returned and ordered enchiladas, nachos. Paul ordered tequila, a salad, waffles with ice cream on top.When the food arrived Paul ordered tater tots and more tequila. They ate silently in the loud bar. Paul felt he would need to scream, or exert an effort that would feel like he was screaming, to be heard. He was aware of Fran, to his left, quietly eating with her mouth near her plate, as if to hide something, or probably to reduce the distance to her enchiladas, which in Paul’s peripheral vision appeared shapeless, almost invisible. After Fran left to “do homework,” she said, Paul and Daniel decided to try watching Drugstore Cowboy again, in Paul’s room.On the walk to Daniel’s apartment, to get Drugstore Cowboy, dozens of elderly, similarly dressed Asian men were standing in a loosely organized row, like a string of Christmas lights, seeming bored but alert, on a wide sidewalk, across from Bar Matchless. Daniel asked one of them what movie they were in and the Asian man seemed confused, then said “Martin Scorsese” without an accent when Daniel asked again.Around forty minutes later Paul said “that looks like the group of Asians . . . we saw earlier,” realizing with amazement as he saw Bar Matchless that they had unwittingly walked to the same place.Daniel’s two suitemates were seated at a round, thin, foldable table on chairs Paul immediately viewed as “found on the street,” talking to each other, it seemed, after returning from a concert. Except for a broom and what Daniel confirmed—grimly, Paul felt—was a giant plastic eggplant of unknown origin, there was nothing else in the common room.Daniel’s room had a dresser, mattress pad, wood chair, tiny desk. Within arm’s reach, outside his window, was a brick wall covered with gradients of gray ash. Daniel showed Paul, who felt self-conscious and crowded, standing in place, a candle shaped like a lightbulb and said it was from his sister. Paul stared at it, unable to comprehend, in a way that made the behavior seem unreal, exactly why Daniel was showing it to him, with a feeling that he’d misheard, or not heard, something Daniel said a few seconds or minutes ago.Paul woke sitting on his mattress with his back against a wall, beside Daniel, who seemed asleep and was also sitting. The room was palely lit by a cloudy, faintly pink morning. Paul’s MacBook, in front of them, showed Drugstore Cowboy’s menu screen. Paul shifted a little—his right leg was numb—and Daniel began talking in a clear voice, as if he’d been awake a few minutes already. Daniel wanted to ingest Adderall instead of sleep. Paul, who couldn’t remember if they’d watched the movie, distractedly asked what they would do “all day.”“What we normally do. Walk around. Fix my computer.”“I feel . . . sleepy,” said Paul.Daniel said something about Adderall.“I feel like I’ll still be sleepy,” said Paul.“You’ll be awake, trust me.”“I’m not sure if I want to.”“I feel like you’re eight years old or my girlfriend,” said Daniel around five minutes later.“I really don’t know what I want to do,” said Paul grinning.[ADDERALL] Posted by Nate at 6:49 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "ER: ADDERALL",
    "text": "ER: ADDERALL Tuesday, November 20, 2018 ADDERALL An hour later, after each showering at his own apartment, they met and ingested Adderall and walked to Verb, a café without internet, where they drank iced coffee and ingested a little more Adderall, then went in an adjacent bookstore, where Daniel showed Paul a translated book of nonfiction with a similar cover—off-center black dot, white background—as Shawn Olive’s poetry book.“That’s funny,” said Paul grinning, and they got on the L train, then walked to the Apple store on Prince Street. Daniel’s MacBook, which had files he needed for his job as a research assistant to an elderly ghostwriter (of sports autobiographies) who owed him $200, would require two weeks to be fixed. Daniel asked if Paul would go with him to Rhode Island, in three hours, to stay with Fran’s family for a weekend. Paul declined, saying he hadn’t been invited. Daniel  said he confirmed last week but didn’t want to go anymore and that, a few minutes ago, Fran texted she couldn’t, against expectation, get any Oxycodone—without which it was going to be “unbearable,” Daniel felt, for both himself and Fran, to be around Fran’s family. Paul declined again, saying it seemed stressful. It began raining from a partly sunny sky, and they went in an Urban Outfitters. Daniel walked to a table of books and stood without looking at anything, like a tired child waiting for an overbearingly upbeat mother to finish shopping.“You seem worried,” said Paul.“Sorry. I’m trying to think of an excuse to tell Fran.”     It was sunny and cloudless, around twenty minutes later, when they sat side by side on a bench in Washington Square Park. Daniel swallowed something and mutely handed Paul a 20mg Adderall, which Paul swallowed. Two preadolescent girls ran around the fountain area repeatedly. Paul said he felt like he hadn’t run as fast as possible in probably five or ten years. When the Adderall took effect Daniel began to praise Paul’s writing without restraint or pause for twenty to thirty minutes and asked about Paul’s IQ. Paul said it was either 139 or 154. Daniel was quiet a few seconds, then with a slightly troubled expression said his IQ was higher, seeming like he felt more complicatedly doomed, as a person, with this information. Paul said his mother always said that his and his brother’s IQs were exactly the same, but sometimes also said she was required, as a parent, to say that.Daniel said his sister had multiple doctorates, his parents and aunts and uncles were all high-level professors, but he was “not anything.” Paul knew from previous conversations that Daniel, as a teenager, had been on months-long retreats to Buddhist monasteries, culminating in something like a year alone, when he turned 18, in India or Tibet. Daniel walked away to call Fran and Paul read a text from Erin, a friend he met on the internet, asking when his book-release reading in Brooklyn was and if she could visit him around that time. Paul texted his reading was too far in the future for him to remember its date, and that he would be happy to see her. Daniel returned and said he told Fran his computer had to be fixed today, or not for two weeks, and he needed it to do work, because he hadn’t paid last month’s rent, so wasn’t going to Rhode Island, and that “she got really angry.”“I feel like you did the right thing . . . I mean . . . outside of being honest,” said Paul grinning. “Your relationship with her is more accurate now.”“Your use of the word ‘accurate’ is interesting.”“She has a more accurate view of your view of her now probably,” said Paul.

    "title": "LL: ADD LAURA ON FACEBOOK",
    "text": "LL: ADD LAURA ON FACEBOOK Tuesday, November 20, 2018 ADD LAURA ON FACEBOOK When Paul woke, the next afternoon, Laura, 28, had already friended and messaged him on Facebook. She had a MySpace page, as an unsigned rapper, with six songs, including one whose music video, in which she rubs pizza on her face and feeds pizza to her cat, Paul remembered feeling highly amused and impressed by when he first saw it, when it had “gone viral,” to some degree, one or two years ago. In the library, that night, Paul discovered Gabby had defriended him on Facebook and was surprised that Kyle, his closest friend the past two years, except the nine months he was with Michelle, had also defriended him and that both had unfollowed him on Twitter.The next night, outside Taco Chulo, a Mexican restaurant in Williamsburg, Laura apologized for being late and said she’d gotten lost on the walk from her apartment, eight blocks away. Paul asked if she wanted to eat at Lodge, which had “good chicken fingers,” or Taco Chulo, as they’d previously agreed, and she seemed confused. In Taco Chulo a waiter said to sit “anywhere.” Paul watched Laura move very slowly, in a kind of exploring, it seemed, as if through darkness, to arrive at a four-person table, where once seated, with a slightly desperate expression, not looking at Paul, she focused on signaling a waiter. Paul also focused on signaling a waiter. Laura ordered a margarita, then sometimes turned her head 90 degrees, to her right, to stare outside—at the sidewalk, or the quiet street—with a self-consciously worried expression, seeming disoriented and shy in a distinct, uncommon manner indicating to Paul an underlying sensation of “total yet failing” (as opposed to most people’s “partial and successful”) effort, in terms of the social interaction but, it would often affectingly seem, also generally, in terms of  existing. Paul had gradually recognized this demeanor, the past few years, as characteristic, to some degree, of every person, maybe since middle school, with whom he’d been able to form a friendship or enter a relationship (or, it sometimes seemed, earnestly interact and not feel alienated or insane). After finishing a second margarita Laura became attentive and direct, like she’d been at the party, when she had been probably very drunk, Paul realized.“You have a girlfriend?” said Laura, surprised.“No,” said Paul, confused. “Why?”“You said ‘my girlfriend.’ ”Paul said he meant “ex-girlfriend.” Laura said she’d thought he was “a Gaylord,” because at the party he’d been surrounded by males, which someone had called his “fans.” Paul said the party was “like, seventy percent males” and that he had always thought the word “Gaylord” had been invented by someone in middle school for derogatory purposes by combining “gay” and “lord.” When he showed Laura prints of his art (which, according to StatCounter, she’d already seen on one of his websites), she seemed to reflexively feign seeing them for the first time: her eyes, upon sight, became and remained slightly unfocused and she made a noise indicating she was seeing something new, but when he asked if she’d seen them before she said “yeah,” but seemed to continue feigning “no.” Paul, endeared by her extreme and complicated helplessness, took back his art and focused conversation on other topics. They agreed to leave, but continued talking for around forty-five minutes, inviting each other to parties that weekend. Paul felt a kind of panic when they realized the parties were the same night and said “I don’t know what to do” and “maybe they aren’t on the same night.” Laura said they could go to both parties—which seemed immediately obvious—and asked if Paul wanted to go to K&M, where her friend was DJ-ing. Paul carefully said he  did, then went to the bathroom, thinking that for matters involving social interaction he shouldn’t trust himself, at this time, after being mostly alone for around four months.In K&M—empty except for the DJ, bartender, two other people—they each drank two shots of tequila and sat with glasses of beer in a booth, side by side, facing a giant screen showing Half Baked on mute with subtitles. Laura complimented Paul’s hair and level of “casualness” and, going partially under the table, held a candle toward Paul’s shoes—which from Paul’s above-table perspective felt stationary and storage-oriented as shoe boxes—asking what brand they were.“iPath,” said Paul.“I can’t see. What are these?”“iPath. The brand is iPath.”“I like them,” said Laura.“iPath,” said Paul quietly.Laura said her ex-boyfriend was in a band and used heroin and they already stopped seeing each other, but it was “ongoing,” for example he asked her to a movie last week and she went and it was awkward. “I just wish he would disappear,” she said in a sincere-seeming manner, staring at Half Baked, which Paul saw on her right eye as four to six pixels that sometimes changed colors. Laura said she didn’t want to talk about her ex-boyfriend. Paul asked if she’d tried heroin and she said no, but liked painkillers, then nuzzled his shoulder with her head. When he said he had a headache and drugs in his room and asked if she wanted to go there, she seemed instantly distracted (as a reflexive tactic, Paul felt, to not appear too eager) and expressed indecision a few minutes, then said she also had a headache, then directly stated, more than once—in an openly and uncaringly, Paul felt with amusement, confirmation-seeking manner indicating  her previous indecision was at least partly feigned—that she wanted to go to Paul’s room to ingest his drugs.Outside, after fifteen minutes of failing to get a taxi, they began walking purposelessly, both saying they didn’t know the correct direction to Paul’s apartment, maybe twenty blocks away. Paul’s arms felt more tired, from signaling taxis, than “in five years, maybe,” he estimated aloud. They got in a minivan taxi, which after a few minutes dropped them off near the center of a shadowy, tree-heavy intersection.The address was correct, according to the street sign, but Paul didn’t recognize anything, even after turning two full circles while dimly aware, in a detached manner reminding him of his drunkenness, that his behavior’s dizzying effects might be counterproductive. He heard Laura, somewhat obligatorily, he thought, say she was scared, then said he was a little scared, then in a louder voice, as if correcting himself, said he was confused. His inability to recognize anything began to feel like a failure of imagination, an inability to process information creatively. His conscious, helpless, ongoing lack of recognition—his shrinking, increasingly vague context—seemed exactly and boringly like how it would feel to die, or to have died. He felt like he was disappearing. He was aware of having said “is there another Humboldt Street, or something,” when he realized he was—already, without a feeling or memory of recognition—looking at the bronze gate, thirty to forty feet away, of the walkway to the four-story house in which, in an apartment on the second floor, he shared a bathroom and kitchen with Caroline, an administrative assistant at the New School with an MFA in poetry.In Paul’s room Laura tried to identify some of his fifteen to twenty pills and tablets, mostly from Charles, who had mailed them before leaving for Mexico, with her phone but the internet wasn’t working. Paul’s MacBook, which he’d spilled iced coffee on, was in Kansas being affordably repaired. Laura swallowed two of what Paul knew was Tylenol 3. Paul swallowed a Percocet and, somewhat arbitrarily, he felt, three Advil, then turned off the light, saying it was hurting his headache.Paul was aware, as they lay kissing in the dark on his mattress, of Laura petting his upper arm in a manner that seemed independent of their kissing (but, he dimly intuited, because they were of the same source, must be discernibly related, on some level, if only as contributors to some larger system). Laura wanted to continue kissing but couldn’t breathe, she said, because her nose was stuffy. “I’m sorry, I don’t want to be needy,” she said a few minutes later. “But I can’t sleep without noise, like a fan.” Paul turned on the bathroom vent. Caroline turned it off a few minutes later. Paul turned it on and texted Caroline his situation and that he would pay five dollars to keep it on tonight.

    "title": "LL: LAURA",
    "text": "LL: LAURA Tuesday, November 20, 2018 LAURA Paul woke on his back, with uncomfortably warm feet, in a bright room, not immediately aware who or where he was, or how he had arrived. Most mornings, with decreasing frequency, probably only because the process was becoming unconscious, he wouldn’t exactly know anything until three to twenty seconds of passive remembering, as if by unzipping a file—newroom.zip—into a PDF, showing his recent history and narrative context, which he’d delete after viewing, thinking that before he slept again he would have memorized this period of his life, but would keep newroom.zip, apparently not trusting himself.Paul read a text from Laura asking if he wanted to see Trash Humpers tonight. Paul texted he already saw it, and they made plans to record a song in his room in two hours.Laura arrived with Walter, whom Paul hadn’t expected, two hours late and reacted to Paul’s agitation, as they walked from the bronze gate to the house, with resentment and dismissiveness, then became a little apologetic in Paul’s room, showing him texts she’d sent to Walter telling him to hurry.“You can’t blame me,” said Walter, and chuckled. “I don’t even know why I’m here. You suddenly just started texting me to drive you here.”“Now everyone is turning against me,” said Laura smiling nervously, not looking at anyone. Paul asked Walter if it was true, as he’d thought he’d read on Gawker, that Detroit, where Walter was from, only had seven grocery stores. Walter laughed quietly and said that wasn’t true and that Detroit was comparable, he felt, to Ann Arbor maybe. Paul said he was going to Ann Arbor in September, for his book tour, and asked what size it was, and was peripherally aware of Laura turning away, like she’d observed the interaction and concluded something, as she said “now you’re going to ask Walter a lot of questions.”“It’s like Berkeley,” said Walter.“It’s that big?” said Paul in a dreamy voice, and moved, vaguely for privacy, from the mattress to the floor, where he texted Daniel and ingested a Klonopin, weakly thinking “it won’t begin working until I won’t need it as much anymore.” Walter and Laura, who had brought a tambourine and a shaker, talked idly, a few feet from Paul, who thought Walter’s grumpiness after leaving Kyle and Gabby’s party, when he’d wielded a Red Bull Soda, now seemed endearing. Paul noticed Laura looking at his pile of construction paper and said she could have some if she wanted, and she focused self-consciously on wanting some, saying how she would use it and what colors she liked, seeming appreciative in an affectedly sincere manner—the genuine sincerity of a person who doesn’t trust her natural behavior to appear sincere. Paul went outside and opened the bronze gate and laughed a little when Daniel said he should “grow an enormous afro without any warning” for his next author photo and they sat on the front stoop. The late-afternoon sky, in Paul’s peripheral vision, panoramic and mostly unobstructed, appeared rural or suburban, more indicative of forests and fields and lakes—of nature’s vast connections, through the air and the soil, to more of itself—than of outer space, which was mostly what Paul thought of when beneath an urban sky, even in daytime, especially in Manhattan, between certain buildings, framing sunless zones of upper atmosphere, as if inviting space down to deoxygenate a city block. Walter exited the house and mentioned a party in Chelsea and left. Laura exited a few minutes later, meekly holding her tambourine and shaker and some construction paper. “I see you ‘got in on’ the construction paper,” said Paul in the sarcastic, playful voice he’d used to recommend Funyuns the night they met, but with a serious expression. “Good choices, in terms of colors. Good job.”“You said I could have some,” said Laura hesitantly.“I know,” said Paul. “I’m glad you got some.”“Well, I’m going home now,” said Laura with a shy expression, not looking at anyone.• • •Paul hadn’t seen Laura alone since she slept over, five days ago, when he brought a mix CD and Ambien to her room, which was more than half occupied by a full-size bed. She offered him red wine she was drinking from a wineglass and typed “sex tiger woods” into Google and clicked dlisted.com. Adjacent to a photo of Tiger Woods, smiling on a golf course, were blocks of text, in which “Ambien sex haze” was in bold around ten times.Laura typed “ambient” into Google.“No,” said Paul grinning. “That’s the music, delete the t.”Laura laughed and typed “ambien and alcohol and klonopin and” and grinned at Paul and, though she had a Klonopin prescription, Paul knew, and was probably on Klonopin, said “just kidding” and deleted all but “ambien and alcohol.” Every result, it seemed, warned strongly against combining Ambien and alcohol, but Laura said she drank “a lot,” so it would be okay. Paul crawled onto her bed and touched her cat Jeffrey and, after a vague amount of time, became aware of a slight blurriness to his vision, like he was seeing from two perspectives in time, milliseconds apart, and that he felt vaguely sleepy and not nervous. He asked if Laura could turn off the light, which seemed uncomfortably bright. He felt confused, to some degree, by everything, but at a delay, as if continuously realizing past confusions, which could no longer be resolved, so were not problems. They seemed to be watching a foreign movie off her computer, then Paul noticed the light was on and that they were lying against a mound of blankets, kissing lazily, with eyes closed and long pauses, maybe sometimes asleep. He became aware of his mix CD, of some of his favorite songs, sounding unpleasantly, almost nightmarishly, noise-like. Paul realized they were trying to undo his belt and weakly imagined what would happen if his jeans were removed and heard Laura say “we just met” from what seemed like a nearby, inaccessible distance and wondered if he was asleep, or dreaming, but knew he was awake, because he was moving physically. He was trying to remove Laura’s clothing. He felt like he was trying to remove the surface of a glass bottle by pawing at it with oven mitts. He expressed confusion and Laura said “it’s just a skirt . . . and tights” and stopped moving completely, it seemed, as Paul continued touching her strange outfit with hands that felt glossy and fingerless, suspecting at one point, with some sarcasm, that she was wearing a corset.“It’s been two hours, I think,” said Paul after staring at his phone around ten seconds. “Jesus,” he said, and sneezed.[GO TO LUCIE'S PARTY] Posted by Nate at 7:24 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "LL: GO TO LUCIE'S PARTY",
    "text": "LL: GO TO LUCIE'S PARTY Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO TO LUCIE'S PARTY Entering Lucie’s party, an hour and a half later, Paul felt like if he wasn’t careful he would fall in an out-of-control, top-heavy manner toward whomever he was greeting and hurt himself and multiple others by reflexively grabbing people and pulling them down with him in a continuing effort to remain standing. He realized he might be unconsciously hunching his back, to be nearer the floor, when Lucie, though four or five inches shorter, appeared to be above him as she thanked him for linking her magazine on his blog. Paul introduced Lucie and other people to Laura by saying “this is Laura” a few times without looking at anyone’s face, while moving toward areas with less people. “Hey,” said Paul, as he passed Mitch in a crowded space, and mumbled something about “going somewhere,” which in combination with a peremptory nodding was meant to convey they would definitely talk at length, later tonight, since they hadn’t seen each other in a long time—months, maybe.In an empty kitchen, a few seconds later, Paul realized Mitch, who worked for Zipcar, had driven him and Laura—and others—to this party. Paul stared into a refrigerator, bent at his waist, waiting for himself, it seemed, to think or do something. “Trying to choose two beers,” he thought after a vague amount of time, and chose two at random, then found Laura and went with her through a window, onto a fourth-story roof, where they passed a shadowy area, emanating the language-y noises and phantom heat of four to six people, to a higher area, where they were alone. Paul, dangling his legs briefly off the building, scooted backward, passively cooperative, as a distracted-seeming Laura pulled him away  from the edge. They sat facing hundreds of the same type of four-story building, the expanse of which, in most directions, darkened dramatically, creating an illusion that one could see the Earth’s curvature, until blurring, in the distance, into a texture. Sometimes, looking at a city, especially a gray or brown one, at night, Paul would intuitively view it as a small and irreducible thing that arrived one summer and rapidly grew, showing patterns of color on its expanding surface, then was discolored by autumn and removed of its exterior and deadened by winter, in preparation for regrowth, in spring, but was unable, in its form, to enter the natural cycle, so continued growing, in a manner as if faceless and skinless, through summer, autumn, etc., less in belligerence or tyranny, or with some abstruse knowledge of its own rightness, than as a stranded thing, sightless and uninstructed, with an objectless sort of yearning. Seeing the streets and bridges and sidewalks, while living inside a building, locked in a room, one could forget that it was all a single, alien, seeking entity.Paul realized he and Laura had been staring into the distance—unaware of each other, it seemed—for maybe two or three minutes. He looked at her profile. Without moving her head, in a voice like she was still considering if this was true, she said Paul was “devious” for bringing her to a party where another girl liked him.“What girl likes me?”“Lucie,” said Laura after a few seconds, still staring ahead, systematically reinterpreting her and Paul’s prior interactions, it seemed, with this new information.“Why do you think she likes me?”“I can tell,” said Laura, and lit a cigarette.“She has a boyfriend,” said Paul.Laura said something seemingly unrelated about cooking.“You should cook for me,” said Paul distractedly.“You won’t like it—it’ll be dense and unhealthy.”“I like pasta and lasagna,” said Paul, and thought he heard Laura ask if his computer was in Canada and was nervous she might be confusing him for another person. “What computer?”“You said your computer was getting fixed in Canada.”“Oh,” said Paul. “Kansas, not Canada. Yeah, it’s still there.”On their way back inside Paul and Laura passed the shadowy area, from where an unseen Amy said something implying Laura had stolen her cigarettes, using the word “cute” antagonistically. Paul had an urge to accelerate, but Laura, ahead of him, continued at her leisurely pace, maneuvering carefully through the window, into the kitchen.Paul followed a slow-moving Laura through a long, dark, almost boomerang-shaped hallway, which felt briefly room-like, as they sort of lingered in it, or like it wanted to be a room, with furniture and guests, but maybe was shy and too afraid of causing disappointment, so impaired itself with two conspicuous openings to conventionally shaped rooms, a sort of recommendation against itself. Paul and Laura entered a large room of sofas and tables and eight to twelve people, including Daniel, who encouraged Paul to “test-drive” a foot-massage machine, which was on the floor, audibly bubbling hot water.“Take off your shoes and socks,” said Daniel.“I don’t want to use that,” said Paul, and turned around and distractedly sat on a backless, deeply padded, uncomfortable seat, which yielded at least a foot from Paul’s weight. Laura was ten feet away, in a throne-like chair, facing Paul, but not looking at him, or anyone, it seemed. Paul openly  stared at her for around ten seconds, to no response, then moved chips and guacamole onto his lap (partly because he felt anxious about Laura seeming to refuse to look at him) and focused on steadily eating while repeatedly thinking “eating chips and guacamole.” He looked at his hands, and felt his mouth and throat, doing what he was thinking, and felt vaguely confused. Was he instructing his brain? Or was he narrating what he saw and felt?Laura seemed less distracted, but more worried, than before. Paul moved toward her with what felt like a precariously sustained gliding motion and sat against and above her, on the chair’s sturdy armrest, in a comically awkward manner he hadn’t foreseen and was preparing to reverse, by returning to his seat, when Laura lifted his arm and placed it ungently around her neck—maybe a little disappointed that she had to do it herself—where it remained, independent and heavy as a small boa constrictor, for a vague amount of time, during which Paul, remaining almost completely still, felt increasingly reluctant to move, or speak. At some point, maybe three minutes later, Paul asked if Laura wanted to go to the other party.“Yes,” she said.Paul felt like parts of his and Laura’s bodies, as they stood on the front stoop hugging tightly under one umbrella, waiting for Walter’s car, were oppositely charged magnets covered with thick velvet. Paul crawled into Walter’s car’s backseat, spilling red wine; unable to find the cork, he wrapped the bottle in a plastic bag. He faced ahead, seated between two people, and realized no one had cared, or noticed, at all, it seemed, about the wine. Paul thought “I’m in hell” when people began to loudly mimic the guitar parts of the  Led Zeppelin playing from a tape deck, resulting mostly in demonic-sounding noises and a kind of metallic, nightmarish screeching. Paul couldn’t discern if they did this regularly, or if it had just been improvised. “Ambien has a negative effect on music for me,” he thought.At Laura’s friend’s party Paul sat alone at the snacks table, eating crackers and drinking wine, sometimes with unfocused eyes. Then he was sitting on a mattress in a space-module-like bedroom, in which six to ten people, smoking marijuana, watched a video off a MacBook of obese people screaming in pain earnestly while exercising and being screamed at motivationally, in what seemed to be a grotesque parody, or something, of something. Paul felt strong aversion to the video, and also like he’d already experienced this exact situation—he remembered his aversion to the video and the way someone to his right was laughing—and wanted to ask if this already happened, but didn’t know who to ask, then realized he wanted to ask himself. Around an hour later, after more crackers and wine, Paul thought he heard Laura drunkenly say something like “let him through, my new boyfriend,” loud enough for probably ten to fifteen people to have heard, as she beckoned him to sit with her and her three closest friends, including Walter, on a four-seat sofa. Walter drove everyone on the sofa to Laura’s apartment to smoke marijuana, around 3:30 a.m., when the party ended.On the sidewalk, outside Laura’s apartment, a heavily impaired Paul explained that in high school his lungs collapsed three times and one of the doctors said smoking marijuana would increase the chance of recurrence by 4,200 percent. Laura said he wouldn’t have to smoke. Paul said the smoke would be in the air and that he was allergic to Laura’s cat and had a horrible headache. He hugged Laura, then walked toward the Bedford L train station, half a block away.• • •The next night Laura emailed that she wished Paul wasn’t allergic to Jeffrey so he could be with her, in her room, listening to the rain. Paul asked if she wanted to eat dinner together tomorrow night. Laura said she felt like she missed him and “well, I guess I’ll see you tomorrow,” characteristically answering a question indirectly and ending an email casually.Paul was aware he felt mysteriously less interested in her after reading that she felt like she missed him and realized he hadn’t considered what a relationship between them would be like: probably not sustainable, at all, due to a mutual lack of strong interest. He was aware of not acknowledging her line about missing him in his response, which included a short list of restaurants he liked.

    "title": "LL: LAURA...",
    "text": "LL: LAURA... Tuesday, November 20, 2018 LAURA... Paul met Laura the next night outside the clothing boutique in SoHo where she worked. “I think this is a bad idea, I always go home after work to nap,” she said with a worried expression, walking slowly away from Paul, who signaled a taxi, which they exited fifteen blocks later at a deli, where they bought a 40oz and two bottles of beer.Seated, in Angelica Kitchen, they looked at each other directly for the first time that night. Laura seemed anxious and tired. Paul said the restaurant was organic and vegan and Laura said she had been trying to eat better since meeting Paul, who grinned while saying “you’ve been trying to eat butter?” twice, during which Laura began to blush.“I thought you said ‘butter,’ ” said Paul grinning.Laura looked at her hand touching a fork on the table.“I thought you said you’re trying to eat butter.”“Stop,” said Laura moving the fork slowly toward herself.“Stop what?”“You’re making fun of me, I think,” said Laura looking at him tentatively.“No, I’m not. I wouldn’t do that.”Laura was motionless, looking at her lap with downcast eyes, like she was waiting for Paul to finish. Paul asked if she believed him and she didn’t respond and he felt stranded and withering and asked again if she believed him, then quietly said “I honestly thought you said ‘butter.’ ” He nervously moved a spoon to his lap and, aware they were both looking down, felt himself absorbing the irresolution of the butter misunderstanding as an irreversible damage. He asked if she wanted to leave, for a different restaurant maybe. Laura poured beer from the 40oz into Paul’s glass, already 95 percent full, and said “let’s just drink more, I just need to drink more” and apologized for “being like this.”“It’s okay,” said Paul. “I’m sorry about the butter thing.”Laura blushed and looked down by slowly moving her eyeballs. Paul apologized and said he wouldn’t talk about it anymore and that he liked Laura’s eyebrows, which were black, in contrast to her naturally blond hair. They talked tensely, with a few long pauses, about the difference between Scottish and Irish people and Paul began to worry about the rest of dinner, but after they finished the 40oz and mutely focused on their menus a few minutes they settled into a calm, polite, somewhat resigned manner of leisurely occupying each other. When their mashed potatoes, chili, corn-bread, noodle soup arrived they talked less and Paul began to feel a little sleepy. Laura thanked him for showing her this restaurant, which she wanted to try lunch from soon.Outside, on the sidewalk, Laura immediately walked toward the 1st Avenue L train station at an unleisurely pace, seeming  less rushed than resolutely continuing with a prior, focused, unobstructed momentum. Paul realized, with some confusion, that he’d obliviously assumed they would do something together after dinner; more than once, as they waited for the bill, he’d considered suggesting they see a movie at a theater that was in the opposite direction they were currently walking. Laura was crossing streets and sidewalks at unconventional angles, as if across a field, in a diagonal, it seemed, to get there sooner. Paul wanted to stop moving and sit or lay on the sidewalk, partly as a juvenile tactic to interrupt Laura’s departure.On the train Laura became significantly more talkative and, it seemed, happier. Paul thought of how at every job he’d had, in movie theaters and libraries and restaurants, almost every employee, probably especially himself, would become predictably friendlier and more generous as closing time neared. At the Bedford station, before exiting the train, Laura apologized again and unsolicitedly said “maybe I’ll feel better and come over later, in a few hours,” which seemed to Paul like a non sequitur, or an extreme example of the “closing time” effect.In his room, with the light on, Paul lay entirely beneath his blanket, aware that Michelle was the last person who’d affected him this cripplingly—to zero productivity, not even listening to music, motionless between his blanket and mattress like some packaged thing. He heard a ringing noise, or the memory of a ringing noise, which meant another of his limited number of nonregenerative hearing cells had died, though his room was nearly silent. He became aware of himself remembering a night when he and Michelle, alone in her mother’s mansion-like house in Pittsburgh, made salad and pasta for dinner and sat facing each other, bisecting a  long wood table like a converted canoe. Paul had begun to feel depressed without knowing why—maybe unconsciously intuiting what life would be like in a giant house with a significant other and a routine, how forty or fifty years, like windows on a computer screen, maximized on top of each other, could appear like a single year that would then need to be lived repeatedly, so that one felt both nearer and withheld from death—and within a few minutes was silent and visibly troubled, staring down at his salad. Michelle had asked what was wrong and Paul had said “nothing,” then she’d asked again and he’d said he felt depressed, but didn’t know why, then at some point she went upstairs, where Paul found her on her bed, in her room that seemed too big for one person, in a fetal position on her side—oval and exposed, on top of her sheets and blanket, as an egg. Paul dreamed something about his cube-shaped room being a storage facility in which he’d been placed by an entity that believed in his resale value. While in storage he could interact with others, look at the internet, go on a book tour, but if he damaged himself he would be moved to a garbage pile, on a different planet. He woke a few times, then remained awake, obstructed from sleep by his own grumpiness and discomfort, the main reasons he wanted to sleep.He reached outside his blanket and pulled his MacBook “darkly,” he felt, toward himself, like an octopus might. It was 12:52 a.m., almost three hours since leaving Angelica Kitchen. Laura, to Paul’s surprise, had emailed twice—a few sentence fragments apologizing for her awkwardness at 11:43 p.m., a paragraph of elaboration at 12:05 a.m. Paul emailed that he understood and liked her and thought she was “cool.” She responded, a few minutes later, seeming cheerful. After a few more emails she seemed almost “giddy.” They committed—earnestly and enthusiastically, Paul felt—to get tattoos together tomorrow.• • •Laura arrived around 4:30 p.m., seeming tired and distracted, with cheese and a bottle of wine and knitting materials in a plastic bag. Paul said they should go to Manhattan before night and Laura asked why and Paul said for tattoos. Laura said she wanted to stay inside to work on her set of a dozen “monster masks,” which she wanted to use in a music video for one of her songs (and which, based on photos Paul had seen on the internet, she seemed to have been knitting for more than a year). They shared a Klonopin, and when it began to get dark outside Paul suggested a restaurant two blocks away, but Laura didn’t want to go outside, so they ordered Chinese food—minnow-size pieces of slippery chicken in a shiny garlic sauce, six fortune cookies—and ate only a little, then shared an Ambien and sat, at a distance from each other, on Paul’s mattress.Paul patted the area beside him and Laura said “stop trying to make sexy time” in an earnest, slightly annoyed voice. Paul grinned and honestly said he wasn’t and felt confused. Laura, who had finished most of the bottle of wine herself, lay curled in a corner of the mattress and was soon asleep. Paul absently looked at the internet a little, then woke, three hours later, around midnight, to Laura putting her things into her plastic bag. She was going home, she said, because she had to feed Jeffrey and had work in the morning.

    "title": "LL: GO BACK TO SLEEP",
    "text": "LL: GO BACK TO SLEEP Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO BACK TO SLEEP The next night Paul was with Mitch and Matt—another classmate from Florida, one year ahead of Mitch and Paul, currently “on vacation” alone—at Barcade, a bar with dozens of arcade machines. After one beer Paul texted Laura “hi, how’s it going” and interpreted her almost instantaneous response of “super” as her wanting to finish an undesirable  task as quick as possible. Paul texted he was at Barcade with “high school friends” and if Laura wanted to come. Laura texted “I’m all out of quarters” after five minutes. Paul texted “I have some quarters for you” with a neutral expression and a cringing sensation, then showed Mitch and Matt the texts, saying he felt depressed. Matt’s friend Lindsay (whom he was staying with while on vacation) arrived and everyone walked six blocks to a bar with outdoor Ping-Pong tables. Daniel arrived with his friend Fran, 22, whose intriguing gaze, Paul noticed with interest, seemed both disbelieving and transfixed in discernment, as if meticulously studying what she knew she was hallucinating. Paul looked at his phone—it had been more than an hour since he texted Laura that he had quarters and, as expected, she hadn’t responded—and heard Daniel say “a Mexican place” and something about “six tacos” to Mitch.“Eight tacos,” said Paul absently.“I said six tacos,” said Daniel.“Six tacos,” said Paul. “Was it, like . . . a taco platter?”“No. This place has small tacos.”“It wasn’t a taco platter?”“It wasn’t a taco platter,” said Daniel.“I don’t get it,” said Paul without thinking.“Bro,” said Daniel grinning.Paul asked Fran what she had eaten.“Enchiladas,” said Fran.“I can never remember what those are,” said Paul, and went to the bathroom. When he returned Lindsay invited everyone to her Cinco de Mayo party—in five days, at her apartment—then everyone, except Fran, who Daniel said was an undergrad at Columbia and had left to do homework, walked eight blocks to a bar called Harefield Road to meet a group of people Paul knew as acquaintances from his involvement in poetry. Seconds after sitting in the outdoor  area Paul openly said “I want to comfort myself with food” without looking at anyone, in a relatively loud voice, with a bleak sensation of unsatisfying catharsis from having accurately, he felt, expressed himself. “I’m just going to eat whatever tonight,” he said, and stood, asking if anyone knew about food options at this bar. Two acquaintances said there were, at this time, around 2:30 a.m., only paninis. One of Daniel’s two suitemates, who said she’d written an article about Paul and reviewed books anonymously for Kirkus, went with him to order a panini. Paul asked if she liked a baseball book, which she mentioned having reviewed, and she talked without pause for what seemed like ten minutes, during which Paul, staring at her calmly, thought “she’s definitely drunk” and “normally I would be interested in her, to some degree, but currently I’m obsessed with Laura” and “she seems maybe focused on not appearing drunk, which is maybe affecting her perception of time, of how long and off-topic and incomprehensible her answer has become.” Paul carried his panini outside and “openly exchanged witty banter while feeling severely depressed,” he thought while speaking to various acquaintances. One said she’d met Paul, when he lived with Shawn Olive, at least three times. Paul said he didn’t recognize her, but also had forgotten that he’d once lived with Shawn Olive. He ate half his panini and said it was unsatisfying and left the bar and returned with Tate’s cookies and Fig Newmans, which he offered to each person. He asked Lindsay what her roommate, whom she’d been talking about, was doing. Lindsay said “sleeping, watching TV, or smoking weed” and Paul said “we should go to your apartment,” aware he was somewhat desperately, if maybe sarcastically, trying to direct his interest away from Laura, toward any girl he had not yet, but still could, meet tonight.“This bar’s special feature: ‘paninis until really late,’ ” said Paul to a drunk-looking acquaintance on the way out.• • •In Lindsay’s apartment’s common room Paul sat eating Fig Newmans on one side of a five-seat sofa with Mitch and Daniel on the other side. Lindsay’s roommate was sleeping. Paul was vaguely aware, as he reread texts from Laura, of people pressuring Matt to smoke marijuana. Matt was standing alone in a corner of the room—seeming in Paul’s peripheral vision like a figure in a horror movie—saying things, as explanation for his choice not to smoke marijuana, about his grandfather’s alcoholism. Paul half-unconsciously mumbled something—to himself, he felt—about feeling thirsty and within a few seconds Matt was standing above him asking if he wanted water. After bringing him a glass of water Matt asked if Paul wanted to use his MacBook to look at the internet. Paul felt endeared to a degree that—in combination with his distraught emotional state, and as he dwelled a few seconds on how Matt’s behavior was like the opposite of pressuring someone to smoke marijuana—he felt like crying. Matt returned with a large MacBook from the room he was sleeping in while on vacation.“Thank you,” said Paul smiling.“You’re very welcome,” said Matt.“You’re being really nice to me.”“You’re the guest here,” said Matt, and Paul gingerly asked if he “by chance” had an iPod cord, sensing he would enjoy further indulging an appreciative subject with his gratuitous helpfulness. Paul accepted Matt’s iPod cord with a sensation, he felt, of daintiness, which remained as he transferred mostly pop-punk songs from Matt’s MacBook to his iPod nano. Around 4:30 a.m., in his room, Paul bit a piece of a 150mg Seroquel and listened to songs he hadn’t heard since high school, mostly the EP Look Forward to Failure by the Ataris. He woke at night fifteen hours later and, while showering, felt like he lived in a module attached to a spaceship far enough from any star to never experience daylight.

    "title": "LL: TRY FORGET LAURA",
    "text": "LL: TRY FORGET LAURA Tuesday, November 20, 2018 TRY FORGET LAURA Paul hadn't seen Laura for almost four weeks when, on the fourth-story roof of Lindsay's apartment with Daniel and Fran, he found Laura had deactivated her Facebook. Paul said he wanted to run “really fast in a circle,” vaguely aware and mostly unconcerned, though he knew he didn’t want to die—less because he had an urge to live than because dying, like knitting or backgammon, seemed irrelevant to his life—that due to alcohol and Klonopin, in a moment of inattention, he could easily walk off the building. He collided with an unseen Fran—who seemed already confused, before this, standing alone in an arbitrary area of the roof—and felt intrigued by the binary manner that his movement was stopped, though how else, he vaguely realized, could something stop? He texted Laura, inviting her to “come eat Mexican food at a party,” then went downstairs and indiscriminately moved refried beans, guacamole, three kinds of chips, cucumber, salsa, beef onto his plate until he had a roughly symmetrical mound of food, on top of which—on the way out of the kitchen, as a kind of afterthought—he added a fluffy, triangular wedge of cake. After carrying the Mayan-pyramid-shaped plate of food, with some difficulty, up the ladder, onto the roof, where he silently ate it all, he belligerently directed conversation toward Laura-related things, then said he felt cold and was going inside. He descended the ladder until his head was below the opening to the roof and tried to hear what Fran and Daniel—who remained outside smoking—were saying, while unaware of his presence, but couldn’t, and also didn’t know what could possibly be said that he would want to secretly hear, so returned inside the apartment and lay on his back on the sofa in the common room.He woke to flash photography, then to Lindsay’s voice, in another room, loudly saying “get out.” Lindsay entered the common room and said, to a blearily waking Paul, something about “your friend” looking inside her purse, trying to steal her shoes. Paul stared blankly, a little embarrassed to have slept on his back, for an unknown amount of time, on the apartment’s only sofa. He looked at his phone: no new texts. After saying “sorry” a few times to Lindsay, who seemed unsure if she felt negatively toward Paul, he put a half-eaten onion, beer bottles, other trash into his Whole Foods bag and descended stairs behind Daniel and Fran, who was quietly murmuring things vaguely in her defense. They decided to go to Legion, a bar, one and a half blocks away, with an outdoor area on the sidewalk.“Were you trying to steal her shoes?” said Daniel.“No, I wasn’t,” said Fran quietly. “Our shoes look the same.”“I’m asking because you’ve told me you like to steal things when you’re drunk.”“I wasn’t stealing her shoes,” said Fran in a loud whisper.They were walking toward Paul’s room, after ten minutes in Legion, when it became known, in a manner that seemed sourceless, as if they realized simultaneously, that Fran had “accidentally,” she then said, stolen a leather jacket, which she was wearing. They agreed it would be inconvenient for the owner to not have their phone, which was in the jacket, but continued walking and each tried on the jacket, which seemed to best fit Paul, who found two gigantic vitamins in one of its pockets. In his room he put the phone on the table beside his mattress and, saying he didn’t want to be near it, sort of pushed it away. He opened his MacBook and played “Annoying Noise of Death” and saw that Daniel was calmly observing himself, in the full-length wall mirror, as he exercised with Caroline's five-pound weights that were usually on the floor in the kitchen. Fran said to put on Rilo Kiley. Paul said it was Rilo Kiley and, after a few motionless seconds, Fran slowly turned her head away to rotate her face, like a moon orbiting behind its planet, interestingly out of view. Paul grinned to himself as he lay on his back and propped up his head with a folded pillow, resting his MacBook against the front of his thighs, both knees bent. Daniel sat on the mattress in a position that a robot in a black comedy about a child with two fathers, one of whom was a robot, would assume to recite a bedtime story, looking at Paul however with a slightly, stoically puzzled expression. “When you asked me if I liked Rilo Kiley, the night we met, I thought you were joking,” said Daniel.“No,” said Paul. “Why did you think that?”“You’re more earnest than I thought you’d be.”“I wouldn’t joke about something like that.”“Like what?” said Daniel.Paul said he wouldn’t pretend he liked something, or make fun of liking something, or like something “ironically.” Daniel sort of drifted away and began looking at Paul’s books with a patient, scholarly demeanor—in continuation, Paul realized, of a calm inquisitiveness that had characterized most of his behavior tonight, probably due to the five Klonopin he’d ingested, though he was always inquisitive and would continue asking questions, in certain conversations, when others would’ve stopped, which Paul liked. Twenty minutes later Daniel was reading pages of different books and Paul was looking at methadone’s Wikipedia page (“. . . developed in Germany in 1937 . . . an acyclic analog of morphine or heroin . . .”) when Fran returned from outside with cuts on her face and neck from a group of girls, she said, that called her a bitch and said she tried to steal shoes and attacked her, pushing her down. Daniel asked how the girls opened the gate to the house’s walkway. Fran repeated, with a vaguely confused expression, that she was attacked. Paul, who hadn’t realized she had left the room, asked how she reentered the gate without a key. Fran stared expectantly at Daniel with her child-like gaze, then quietly engaged herself in a solitary activity elsewhere in the room as Daniel and Paul began pondering the situation themselves, to no satisfying conclusion. Fran said she wanted to go dancing at Legion before it closed in less than an hour and Paul thought he saw her put a number of pills into her mouth in the stereotypically indiscriminate manner he’d previously seen only on TV or in movies. Fran and Daniel did yoga-like stretches on Paul’s yoga mat and snorted two Adderall—crushed into a potion-y blue, faintly neon sand—off a pink piece of construction paper. Daniel briefly hugged a supine Paul, then stood at a distance as Fran lay flat on top of Paul with her head facedown to the right of his head. Fran didn’t move for around forty seconds, during which, at one point, she murmured something that seemed significant but, muffled by the mattress, was not comprehensible. She rolled onto her back and Daniel pulled her to a standing position. Paul was surprised to feel moved in a calming, tearful manner—as if some long-term desire, requiring a tiring amount of effort, had been fulfilled—when, before leaving for Legion, both Daniel and Fran affected slightly friendlier demeanors (rounder eyes, higher-pitched voices, a sort of pleasantness of expression like minor face-lifts) to confirm meeting at the book party Paul mentioned earlier and had forgotten.Paul realized after they left that he’d gotten what from elementary school through college he often most wanted—unambiguous indications of secure, mutual friendships—but was no longer important to him.

    "title": "E: ERIN",
    "text": "E: ERIN Wednesday, November 21, 2018 ERIN Eight people were in Erin’s five-seat car, which had gotten lost on its way from Paul’s book-release reading in Brooklyn to DuMont Burger, also in Brooklyn, when it was stopped by a police car, in Manhattan, around two hundred feet from the Williamsburg Bridge. The officer shined a flashlight through the driver’s window at the backseat without bending to see what was there, then asked Erin, 24, who had driven four hours that day from Baltimore to attend Paul’s reading and visit friends, to step outside the car. Paul, in the front passenger seat, hadn’t seen Fran, who was sitting partly on him, or Daniel, in the backseat, in five or six weeks, except once, briefly and separately, at a Bret Easton Ellis reading three weeks ago, when they’d avoided each other, and Fran, without context, had shown Paul a text from Daniel insulting her in a strangely formal, almost aristocratic tone. Paul had communicated regularly, the past month, only with Charles, by email or Gmail chat, mostly about what food they had eaten, or were thinking about eating, to “console” themselves. After being more social, April to July, than any other period of his life, Paul had returned to his default lifestyle, which varied, to some degree, but generally entailed (1) avoiding most social situations (2) not wanting to sleep most nights and not knowing why—he’d wanted since 2006 to title one of his books I Don’t Want to Sleep but I Don’t Know What I’m Waiting For—resulting usually in four to ten hours of looking at the internet, reading, masturbating, etc. until morning, when he would eat something and sleep until night.Erin, back in her car, said the officer had looked at her two-months-expired, out-of-state driver’s license an abnormally long time, like he’d forgotten what he was doing, before quietly saying “be careful” and allowing her to continue driving, in what seemed to be an egregious oversight, without a ticket or decreasing passengers.Paul first learned of Erin twenty months ago, in January 2009, when she commented on his blog and he clicked her profile and read her pensive, melancholy, amusing accounts, on her blog, of her vague relationships and part-time bookstore job and nights drinking beer while looking at the internet and classes at the University of Baltimore, where she’d reenrolled after a two-year break. Paul found and read—and reread, with high levels of interest—three long stories, each focused on an unrequited or failed relationship, that she had published in online magazines. Erin, being an attractive and adventurous-seeming person, was probably almost always, Paul imagined, entering or leaving—or, in some way, maneuvering—one or more relationships, but probably, between relationships, as a person who seemed to enjoy being alone sometimes, would become more active on the internet, for weeks or months, which over months and years would overlap with Paul’s nearly continuously high levels of internet activity. They would gradually communicate more and maybe begin emailing and—if neither died, entered long relationships, or left the internet—eventually meet in person. Paul viewed this process as self-fulfilling, not something he wanted to track or manipulate, so after one or two weeks had mostly internalized Erin’s existence—as a busy person with a separate life, in a different city—and had stopped thinking about her by mid-February, when he met Michelle, with whom he was in a relationship both times, before tonight, that he met Erin in person.The first time was in July, when Erin visited New York City for the release of Charles’ poetry book. The day after the release Paul was amused and excited for them, at a BBQ, when Charles said he had kissed Erin.The second time was in September, one year ago, when Erin attended Paul’s reading in Baltimore. At a restaurant, with a large group of people, but talking only to each other, Paul asked about Charles, whom Erin had visited in August. Erin said she had changed her plane ticket and left earlier than planned because Charles had become gradually less affectionate, culminating with a night when, after sex, he said he didn’t feel anything for her, then consoled her, as she cried, in his kitchen. Paul liked Erin’s forthright, unhesitant, nonjudgmental answers and that she was able—already, despite what seemed like strong disappointment—to view and describe what had happened as at least partly amusing. When Erin asked about Michelle, as they walked to her car, Paul automatically said Michelle was “good” while distinctly recalling a recent night when he complained he always offered her food or drink before himself, then after Michelle said she’d be happy to do that, now that she knew it mattered to him, said it didn’t matter to him and she shouldn’t change. Exiting Erin’s car, at the hotel he was staying in for  one night, because a mysterious Johns Hopkins professor, whose Face-book name was “Cloud Bat,” had bought him a room, Paul thought that if he weren’t in a relationship with Michelle he would ask Erin upstairs, where they would, he vaguely imagined, continue talking.As Erin’s car slowly accelerated away from the police car, onto the Williamsburg Bridge, one person, then another, said they were illegally carrying drugs. After a peculiarly awkward, car-wide silence that became comical when someone asked if every person in the car was illegally carrying drugs, eliciting three affirmations and a sort of confirmatory announcement that every person—Erin, Paul, Daniel, Fran, Mitch, Juan, Jeannie, Jeremy—was illegally carrying drugs, there was the immediately space-filling noise of a small crowd laughing, which continued for around five seconds, during which Paul (who, in sharing his seat with Fran, was partly turned toward the driver’s window) watched the police car, or a police car, zoom past in the left lane, with emergency lights on and sirens off, quick and soundless as an apparition or the hologram of itself.[BURGERS] Posted by Nate at 3:43 AM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Home"

    "text": "E: BURGERS Wednesday, November 21, 2018 BURGERS In DuMont Burger’s bathroom Paul swallowed half of half a 30mg Oxycodone and .5mg Xanax, feebly amused to be already deviating, in moderate excess, from his plans to ingest specific amounts of drugs at certain times during his book tour, September 7 to November 4. To determine what amount of what drugs—MDMA, LSD, any benzodiazepine, amphetamine, opiate—he should ingest, on what days, to minimize anxiety and boredom for himself and others, he’d edited the seven-page itinerary from his publisher to fit on one page and, in an idle process he’d enjoyed, the past few weeks, studied each event in context, writing notes on the paper. He’d printed a final draft, currently in his pocket, that said he should ingest something—specified, in most instances, by type and amount—before twenty-two of his twenty-five events and some miscellaneous things such as the day a writer from BlackBook was writing an article about “hanging out” with him while doing that.Paul splashed water on his face, which he dried, then returned to his seat, next to Juan, who was talking to Jeremy about whether a horse could win “best athlete of the year.” Erin, the only person Paul felt like talking to, at the moment, was out of range, so when two acquaintances who didn’t know anyone else arrived Paul sat with them at a four-person table, where he felt self-conscious about the tenuousness of his situation—he hadn’t ordered food because he was nauseated from the Oxycodone and long car ride and he didn’t have anything he wanted to say to anyone. When a friend of the acquaintances arrived, sitting at the table’s fourth seat, Paul fixated on her—maybe partly to justify his increasingly pointless, idle presence—in an exaggerated manner (asking her questions continuously while sustaining a “concentrating expression” with such intensity, muddled by the onset of the drugs he’d used in the bathroom, that he sometimes felt able to sense the weight of the microscopic painting of the restaurant’s interior, decreased by a dimension and scaled down to almost nothing, resting on the top curvature of his right eyeball) that felt conducive to abruptly stopping and leaving, which he did, after around fifteen minutes of increasingly forced conversation, walking six blocks to his room.[OHIO] Posted by Nate at 10:33 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "E: OHIO",
    "text": "E: OHIO Wednesday, November 21, 2018 OHIO Paul’s book tour’s fourth reading—after another in Brooklyn and one at a Barnes & Noble in the financial district—was in Ohio, on September 11. Calvin, 18, and Maggie, 17, seniors in high school who’d been friends since middle school and were currently in a relationship, had invited Paul and Erin and other “internet friends” to read at a music festival and stay two nights in Calvin’s parents’ “mansion,” as Paul called it.The day after the reading Paul and Erin ingested a little LSD and shared a chocolate containing psilocybin mushrooms and sat in sunlight in Calvin’s backyard, which had a hot tub and swimming pool and skateboard ramp and basketball hoop, “working on things” on their MacBooks. When Calvin returned from school they got in his SUV to go to Whole Foods, where Maggie was meeting them after work at American Apparel, and shared another chocolate. Calvin, who hadn’t wanted any, meekly asked if maybe he’d feel good if he ate only a small piece, seeming like he wanted to be encouraged to try.“We already ate it,” said Paul, and laughed a little, in the backseat.Erin, in the front passenger seat, was still holding a piece. Hearing Calvin she had seemed to slow its movement toward her mouth. She made a quiet, inquisitive noise and glanced slightly toward Paul, then resumed a normal speed and placed it inside her mouth. Paul lay on his back for most of the drive, sometimes sitting to noncommittally mumble something relevant, including that he liked Stereolab and Rainer Maria, to what he could hear of Calvin and Erin’s conversation. Walking toward Whole Foods, across its parking lot, Paul said he was “beginning to feel the LSD, maybe.”“Really?” said Erin. “I feel . . .”“I don’t know,” said Paul.“I can’t tell what I feel,” said Erin, and automatic doors opened and they entered the produce section, where they held and examined different coconuts. Calvin stood looking back, seeming tired and a little afraid, like a reclusive uncle supervising his unruly niece and outgoing nephew.“You should get one,” said Paul. “It’s refreshing.”“I’m . . . allergic,” said Calvin a little nervously.“Shit,” said Paul grinning. “I forgot. Again. Sorry.”The next few minutes, while Paul and Erin went to three different sections—butcher, pizza, sushi—to get their coconuts opened, Calvin remained at a far distance, randomly and inattentively picking up and looking at things and sometimes glancing at Paul and Erin with a worried, socially anxious expression. Something about Calvin, maybe a corresponding distance or that they had similar body types, reminded Paul of Michelle, the night of the magazine-release party, waiting with slack posture at a red light, before she touched his arm and leaned on the metal fence. Paul, in line to pay, considered saying the word “Kafkaesque” to describe getting their coconuts opened, but was distracted by an eerily familiar actress’s smiling face on a magazine cover and remained silent, then paid and maneuvered to a booth and sat by Erin, across from Calvin, who stared at them with wet eyes and a beseeching, insatiable, inhibited expression that alternated between Paul and Erin to keep both, Paul thought, locked into his meekly laser-like gaze. Paul held his left hand like a visor to his forehead and looked down and sometimes said “oh my god.” Whenever he glanced at Erin, who seemed to be enjoyably displaying an unceasing grin, he laughed uncontrollably and, due to the contrast with Calvin’s alienated demeanor, felt more uncomfortable. Unsure how to stop grinning, or what to do, he left the booth for straws. When he returned, after feeling mischievous and Gollum-like for two to three minutes while trying to secretly record Erin and Calvin with his iPhone, he lowered himself skillfully, he felt, in a 180-degree turn, like that of a screw, to a seated position, flinging a straw at Erin while connecting the awning of his left hand to his forehead. He moved his coconut to his lap and heard a partially metallic, imaginary-sounding noise. He stared without comprehension, but also without confusion, at Calvin’s body, which was hunched close to the table with demonically jutting shoulder blades rising and falling in rhythm to what sounded like a computer-generated squawking. The cube of space containing Calvin seemed to be reconfiguring itself, against passive resistance from the preexisting configuration of Calvin, mutating him in a process of computerization. Paul thought he was witnessing a kind of special effect, then realized Calvin was imitating a pterodactyl.“I feel so much better now,” said Calvin. “Just doing what I want . . . what I want to do . . . yeah. Before, I was holding back, so I felt bad. I feel so much better now.”“You were making pterodactyl noises,” said Paul in disbelief.Maggie appeared as a desultory object, rapidly approaching the booth in a horizontal glide, seeming unnaturally small and eerily low to the ground. “LSDs, LSDs,” she was saying in a high-pitched, taunting, witch-like voice. Paul, who was laughing and repeatedly saying “oh my god” and variations of “I can’t believe this is happening,” heard Calvin say “they’re not on LSD.” Maggie said “magic mushrooms” and seemed to be imitating an elf as she entered the booth behind Erin and Paul, who heard Erin say “we’re on LSD and mushrooms,” and briefly visualized the main character from Willow, the dwarf with magical powers. Things seemed defectively quiet, like before an explosion in a movie, the five to ten seconds before Maggie rose in the booth behind Paul, who turned and saw a faceless mound: Maggie, with her entire head inside a black beanie, saying “is this the front of me or back.”The next night Paul and Erin ate their last remaining chocolates in Calvin’s SUV driving back from a movie theater where they had bought tickets for X-Men: First Class after deciding to go and “group livetweet” whatever movie fit their schedule.  At Calvin’s house they discussed what to do now, for an activity, but couldn’t decide—each person seemed committed to not deciding—and became locked into what felt like a three-way staring contest, which they mutely sustained, each person alternating between the other two, for thirty to forty seconds, until Paul bluntly said he wanted to “go for a walk with only Erin, outside,” and, after mumbling something incoherent about mushrooms—vaguely wanting to convey it was uncomfortable while on mushrooms to be around people not on mushrooms—quickly gained Erin’s assent and repeatedly positioned himself to displace, or push, her toward where he was going, until both were outside the room, in a dark hallway, where they huddled together and maneuvered grinning to winding stairs, which they descended holding hands, toward the front door. On their They walked down the driveway into the upper-middle-class neighborhood with their inside arms folded up and against each other. Most front yards had one or two fashionably sculpted trees and two or more colorful Boy Scouts–like patches of flowers and plants in independent organization. Paul saw, in a side yard, a pale fence with the colorless, palatially melancholy glow of unicorns and remembered how in Florida, in the second of his family’s three houses of increasing size, both his neighbors had built fences—rows of vertical, triangular-topped slats of wood that had seemed huge, medieval—around their backyards. Paul said he felt like he was in Edward Scissorhands and they sat on a concrete embankment facing the street with their feet on a sidewalk. Paul slightly looked away as he said “there’s so many stars here” without much interest.Erin pointed and asked if one was moving.“In place, maybe,” said Paul uncertainly.“It looks like it’s vibrating,” said Erin.“It’s, um, what thoughts do you have about UFOs?” said Paul looking away, as if not wanting Erin to hear him clearly. “I’m doing it . . . I’m saying stereotypical things that people say while on mushrooms.”“That’s okay. UFOs are interesting.”“I know it’s okay,” said Paul, and asked if Erin had experienced “any UFO things.” Erin said she wore purple and put glitter on her eyes every Friday in fourth grade because she thought, if she did, aliens would notice and take her away.“That seems really good,” said Paul feeling emotional. “All purple?”“No. It just had to be one thing that was purple.”“Where did you think they would take you?”“I don’t think I thought about that,” said Erin. “Just ‘away.’ Anywhere.”“What . . . did your classmates, or other people, think?”“I’ve never told anyone.”“Really? But . . . it’s been so long.”“I didn’t have anyone to tell, really.”“You haven’t told anyone except me?”“No. Let me think. No, I haven’t.”Paul had begun to vaguely feel that he already knew of a similar thing—something about purple glitter and fourth grade, maybe from a children’s book—or was he remembering what he just heard? His voice sounded bored, he thought, as he told Erin about when, as a fourth or fifth grader, he really wanted to see a UFO and was on a plane and saw a brown dot and, without any excitement or sensation of discovery, repeatedly thought to himself that he’d seen a UFO. “I think I was aware at first that I was ‘faking’ it,” said Paul uncertainly. “But . . . I think I convinced myself so hard that I made myself forget that part . . . when I was aware, and I think I really believed I saw a UFO.”“Whoa. Did you tell anyone you saw a UFO?”“I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone. I don’t think I cared if anyone knew. I was just like, ‘I saw a UFO.’ I think I was extremely bored. I was like a bored robot.”[LAKE ERIE] Posted by Nate at 10:43 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "E: LAKE ERIE",
    "text": "E: LAKE ERIE Wednesday, November 21, 2018 LAKE ERIE The next night Erin and Paul met Cristine, 22—a mutual acquaintance from the internet—and Cristine’s friend Sally, 22, in a public park that was closed for the night. Cristine sold Paul eight 36mg Ritalin and ten psilocybin chocolates, wrapped in tinfoil, like little hockey pucks. They each ate a chocolate and walked through the park, to the end of a beach, where they sat in the gently fluorescent light of a half moon that looked like a jellyfish photographed, from far below, in mid-propulsion, its short tentacles momentarily inside itself.In the distance, Cleveland’s three tallest buildings, each with a different shape and style of architecture and lighting, were spaced oddly far apart, like siblings in their thirties, in a zany sitcom. After spending their lives “hating” one another, in a small town, they moved to different cities and were happy, but then got coincidentally transferred by their employers to the same medium-size city. They were all named Frank. Paul felt reluctant to say anything weird because Cristine and Sally were behaving normally, with earnest expressions, as if pretending they weren’t on mushrooms, except sometimes one would mention seeing beautiful colors, increasing Paul’s apprehension because earlier he and Erin had bonded over feeling alienated by people who focused on visuals, instead of people, while on hallucinogens. Deciding, after around fifteen minutes, to drive somewhere in two cars, they walked on the beach toward the parking lot. The clear moonlight sometimes fleetingly appeared, on Lake Erie, to their left, as thin layers of snow, resting on the surface of the water, as if painted on, or briefly riding the shoreward, foamy fronts of tiny waves before vanishing. Sally’s car, on the highway, got a flat tire. Paul and Erin couldn’t stop grinning, due to the mushrooms, sitting on a sidewalk in downtown Cleveland, waiting for AAA, as a frowning Sally, whose car had a missing window covered by a garbage bag, persistently bemoaned her situation without looking at anyone. Cristine, grinning sometimes at Paul and Erin, drove everyone, in Erin’s car, to Kent State University, where Paul and Erin walked far behind  Cristine and Sally, on a slightly uphill sidewalk. “When you said that thing about glitter and purple clothing I felt vaguely like I already knew about it,” said Paul. “You really haven’t told anyone?”“The only person I’ve told is my friend Jennika.”“You said I was the only person you’ve told.”“I know,” said Erin. “I shouldn’t have said that.”“Did you forget? Yesterday?”“No, I knew. I was nervous—I thought I was talking too much.”“But I was asking you about it.”“I thought I was boring you.”“You weren’t,” said Paul. “At all.”“I just wanted to, like, ‘move on.’ ”“Don’t do that. If I ask something I really want to know.”“I know. I don’t want to do that.”“You lied . . . to me,” said Paul, and felt dramatic and self-conscious. “Wait, let me think. I’m thinking if I were you . . . if I would lie about that. I think . . . yeah, I would, if I didn’t want to talk about it.” He would if he didn’t anticipate becoming close to the other person, or talking to them again. “I understand, I think.” He imagined Erin’s inattentive, half-hearted view of him as “vaguely, unsatisfactorily desirable,” like how he viewed most people. “I would lie, like that, in that situation. Are you sure you haven’t written it somewhere? Like on your blog maybe?”“I’m really sure. I’m ninety percent sure.”“Only ninety percent? That’s, like, ‘unsure,’ I feel.”“I’m really sure. I’m ninety-five percent sure.”“You can tell—”“Paul,” said Erin, and grasped his forearm. They stopped walking. More aware of Erin’s perspective, looking at his face ( and not knowing what expression she saw or what he wanted to express), than of his own, Paul didn’t know what  to do, so went “afk,” he felt, and remained there—away from the keyboard of the screen of his face—as Erin, looking at the inanimate object of his head, said “if I did I would tell you” and, emphatically, “I’m not lying to you right now.”“Okay,” said Paul, and they continued walking.Sprinklers could be heard in the distance.“I believe you,” said Paul.“Really?”“Yeah. I haven’t not believed you. I was just saying . . . maybe you got the idea or something similar to it from somewhere else, like a children’s book we’ve both read, but we forgot about it, or something like that.”“I don’t think I did,” said Erin.“I feel like I do that a lot.”“Maybe,” said Erin quietly.Around 1:30 a.m., after Cristine and Sally had left, Paul and Erin were walking in downtown Cleveland trying to find any open restaurant when they entered a hotel through an “employees only” door and ascended on an escalator and walked through dark corridors into an auditorium-like area, encountering no people. Paul imagined the building omni-directionally expanding at a rate exceeding their maximum running speed, so that this goalless, enjoyably calm exploration of a temperature-controlled, tritely uncanny interior would replace his life, with its book tour and Gmail and, he thought after a few seconds, “food.” Would he agree to that? “Yes,” he thought “meaninglessly,” he knew, because he’d still be inside himself, the only place he’d ever be, that he could imagine, though maybe he didn’t know—not knowing seemed more likely.At a Denny’s near the airport Paul ordered a steak and minestrone soup. Erin ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and cheese sticks. They shared a 30mg Adderall and drove to the airport, listening to a ’90s station, both immediately recognizing Natalie Imbruglia’s “Torn,” whose lyrics, to a degree that Paul couldn’t stop grinning, seemed to be a near-unbroken series of borderline non sequitur clichés. Erin had a public-speaking class in Baltimore, eight hours away, in nine and a half hours. At the airport Paul left eight psilocybin chocolates with Erin, who said she would bring them to his reading in Manhattan in four weeks, if not earlier. They hugged tightly, and Paul, whose flight to Minnesota was in four hours, said he wished they had more time to listen to ’90s songs together and that he “had a lot of fun,” with Erin, the past few days.[BACK TO THE FUTURE] Posted by Nate at 10:49 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "E: BACK TO THE FUTURE",
    "text": "E: BACK TO THE FUTURE Wednesday, November 21, 2018 BACK TO THE FUTURE The next three days they texted regularly and, Paul felt, with equal attentiveness. Paul texted a photo of a display in the Mall of America of books titled I Can Make You Confident and I Can Make You Sleep with the author grinning on each cover. Erin texted a blurry photo of what seemed to be a headless mannequin wearing a white dress and said she was in Las Vegas at a cousin’s wedding. Then she texted less, and with less attention, and one night didn’t respond to a photo Paul sent from a café in Chicago, where he was staying for four days, of a Back to the Future poster—He was never in timefor his classes . . .He wasn’t in timefor his dinner . . .Then one day . . .he wasn’t in histime at all.—until morning, when she texted “lol” and that she’d been asleep, but she didn’t reciprocate a photo, or ask a question, so they stopped texting. Paul sensed she was busy with college and maybe one or more vague relationships, but allowed himself to become “obsessed,” to some degree, with her, anyway, reading all four years of her Facebook wall and, in one of Chicago’s Whole Foods, one night looking at probably fifteen hundred of her friends’ photos to find any she might’ve untagged.In a café in Ann Arbor around 10:30 p.m., two days later, Paul realized, when he remembered Erin’s existence by seeing her name in Gmail, he’d forgotten about her that entire day (over the next three weeks, whenever more than two or three days passed since they last communicated, which they did by email, every five to ten days, in a thread Erin began the day she dropped him off at the airport, Paul would have a similar realization of having forgotten about her for an amount of time). Around midnight he drove his rental car to a row of fast-food restaurants near the airport and slept in a McDonald’s parking lot. When he woke, around 2:45 a.m., he bought and ate a Filet-O-Fish from the McDonald’s drive-thru. While trying to discern what, from which fast-food restaurant, to buy and eat next, he idly imagined himself for more than ten minutes as the botched clone of himself, parked outside the mansion of the scientist who the original Paul paid to clone himself and paid again to “destroy all information” regarding “[censored].” He drove across the street to a Checkers drive-thru and bought two apple pies, which he ate with little to no pleasure, almost unconsciously, while distractedly considering how once a bite of it was in his mouth, then chewed once or twice, there seemed to be no choice, at that point, but to swallow. He slept three hours, drove past McDonald’s and Arby’s, returned the rental car,  rode a van as the only passenger to the airport, boarded the earliest flight to Boston.[MANHATTAN] Posted by Nate at 10:56 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "E: MANHATTAN",
    "text": "E: MANHATTAN Wednesday, November 21, 2018 MANHATTAN The day before his Manhattan reading, returning to New York from Philadelphia, where after a bleakly sober reading in a tiny bookstore, which sold only used and rare books, he slept on a mostly empty bus, dropping him off in Brooklyn’s Chinatown, a place he’d forgotten existed. In his room, around 2:30 a.m., he read a 2:12 a.m. email from Erin that said she’d “been using a lot of mental space to think about definitely ending a yearlong, ‘on-and-off,’ semi-vague relationship and actually did tonight”—in reference to someone named Beau—and that she was aware of the insufficiency of her email, half the length of Paul’s email, from nine days ago, but wanted to say before sleeping that she was still coming, if it was “still okay,” she said, to Paul’s reading tomorrow and would bring the psilocybin chocolates Paul left with her one month ago as previously discussed.Increasingly, as his memory occupied less of his consciousness, the past four to six months, whenever Paul sensed familiarity in the beginnings of a thought or feeling he would passively focus on intuiting it in entirety, predicting its elaboration and rhetoric in the presence of logic and world-view like a ball’s trajectory and destination in the presence of gravity and weather. If he recognized the thought or feeling, and didn’t want it repeated, he’d end its formation by focusing elsewhere, like how someone searching for a lost dog on a field at night wouldn’t approach the silhouette of a tree. Paul, reading Erin’s email, was vaguely aware of himself considering that, to some degree, Erin was “using him” to make Beau jealous, or to stay busy while Beau was doing other things maybe—that if things had worked with Beau she might not be coming tomorrow.Without full awareness of what he’d begun to think Paul deliberately stopped thinking and texted: “Yes. Would like if you come, see you tomorrow hopefully.” He called his publisher  at 3:04 a.m., leaving a voice mail saying he understood what they probably wanted to say, that he was sorry and wouldn’t do it again—vaguely he remembered that they had, at some point, told him they disapproved of him using mushrooms at a reading—and was available by email, then slept.Paul was in Bobst Library around 3:30 p.m. and had just ingested a capsule of MDMA when Erin texted that she was around fifty minutes away. Paul walked ten blocks to the bookstore and sat on a tiny bench in the fiction section and tweeted and looked at his Gmail account. Erin texted she was in the store and had eaten a chocolate. Paul was surprised she was with a male friend, whom she introduced as a former coworker named Gary, who lived in Brooklyn.“He’s gay,” said Erin, and gave Paul a chocolate, which he chewed into a gluey paste and swallowed with lemon water from the bookstore’s café. After the reading Paul, Erin, and Gary walked to a bar for someone’s 33rd birthday. Gary left after around ten minutes and Erin said he had whispered in her ear that he felt sad and wanted to talk. “I told him I couldn’t now, I’m on mushrooms,” said Erin. “Then he asked me for mushrooms. I said I didn’t have any and he probably shouldn’t have them now anyway and I’d call him tomorrow.”Around three hours later Paul and Erin were stomach-down on Paul’s mattress watching YouTube videos of people answering the same questions sober and on hallucinogens. Paul, who kept clicking new videos, was amused by how he seemed to be comfortably and energetically, with only a little self-consciousness, “having fun,” he kept thinking, in contrast to Erin, who seemed shy in a tired, depressed, distracted manner indicating to Paul that she was maybe thinking  about someone else, probably Beau, whom she would probably rather be with, at the moment, instead of Paul, who felt intrigued—and further amused—why he was not affected by this information, which normally would make it impossible for him to enjoy anything. They slept without touching, woke in the afternoon, drove to Manhattan, where they separately “worked on things” (Paul in the library, Erin in a Starbucks) until 9:30 p.m., when they ate chocolates and watched a Woody Allen movie, which ended after midnight, on October 15, Erin’s 25th birthday. Paul said he wanted to buy her an expensive dinner and they went in an Italian restaurant that seemed moderately expensive, sat in a corner booth, ordered medium-rare steaks and a shrimp appetizer. Erin asked if she should answer a call from Beau, who’d been calling and texting all night, she said.“If you want, yeah,” said Paul looking down a little.Erin spoke to Beau in a jarringly, briefly absurdly different voice—one of impatient, dominating aggression—than Paul (who recognized the voice as similar to how he spoke, as a child, to his mother) had ever heard her use and which increased his interest in her, knowing she was capable of what to Paul was her opposite. After around fifty seconds, at a moment when she had the opportunity, Paul felt, based on hearing her side of what sounded like a mutual voicing of vague aggravation, to tactfully end the call and unambiguously convey she viewed their relationship as finished, Erin instead prolonged the call by speaking angrily, with sudden emotion indicating she wasn’t indifferent. Paul felt dizzy with the realization, as Erin continued talking in a manner like she’d forgotten his presence, that his view of her was uncontrollably changing, that parts of him were earnestly, if dramatically, no longer viewing her as a romantic possibility. He intuited a hidden intimacy in Erin and Beau’s hostility, a psychic collaboration—unconscious, or maybe conscious for one of them—assembling the structures, located days or weeks from now, where they would meet again to apologize and forgive and, while rescinding their insults, encouraged by the grammar and syntax and psychology of contrasts, near-automatically convey adoration, gratitude, compliments. Was this how people sustained relationships and sanity? By uninhibitedly expressing resentment to unconsciously contrast an amount of future indifference into affection? With quickly metabolized disappointment and a brief, vague, almost feigned restructuring of the mirage-like pile of miscellaneous items of his life Paul acclimated himself to this new reality, in which he would talk to Erin less and never with full attention, always distracted by, if not someone else, the ever-present silhouette of a possible someone else. Erin somewhat abruptly ended the call and asked if it had been entertaining, or interesting, or at least not too boring.“I was really interested.”“It was okay? Not boring?”“No. I felt high levels of interest.”“Oh,” said Erin. “Good.”“I was surprised. You sounded angry.”“Yeah,” said Erin. “I was angry.”“There was one part . . . when you started fighting more, instead of stopping, I felt, like, afraid,” said Paul, and Erin said she knew what part he was referencing and that she had specifically considered if he would be entertained, or not, and had felt uncertain. As a waiter served their medium-rare steaks and, on multicolored rice, cooked into fetal positions, eight medium-large shrimp, Paul realized with some confusion that he might have overreacted. Staring at the herbed butter, flecked and large as a soap sample, on his steak, he was unsure what, if he had overreacted, had been the cause.  It occurred to him that, in the past, in college, he would have later analyzed this, in bed, with eyes closed, studying the chronology of images—memories, he’d realized at some point, were images, which one could crudely arrange into slideshows or, with effort, sort of GIFs, maybe—but now, unless he wrote about it, storing the information where his brain couldn’t erase it, place it behind a toll, or inadvertently scramble its organization, or change it gradually, by increments smaller than he could discern, without his knowledge, so it became both lost and unrecognizable, he probably wouldn’t remember most of this in a few days and, after weeks or months, he wouldn’t know it had been forgotten, like a barn seen from inside a moving train that is later torn down, its wood carried elsewhere on trucks.Erin was flying to the College of Coastal Georgia in the morning to read to writing students and stay five to ten days as a kind of vacation. They confirmed to meet in Baltimore in three weeks, at the last reading of Paul’s book tour, to film themselves answering questions, on MDMA and while sober, to edit into videos like they’d seen on YouTube.[BALTIMORE] Posted by Nate at 11:02 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "E: BALTIMORE",
    "text": "E: BALTIMORE Wednesday, November 21, 2018 BALTIMORE After his book tour’s last reading, on November 4, in Baltimore, Paul declined multiple dinner and bar invitations and went with Erin to her apartment—a bedroom, bathroom, tiny kitchen, TV room—where, using iMovie on Erin’s MacBook, they recorded themselves on MDMA answering questions each had prepared for the other, then continued recording, sitting on Erin’s bed, as they showed each other things on the internet, wanting to later be able to see how they behaved while on MDMA. Erin’s iPhone made a noise, at one point, and Paul, who had wrapped himself in a thick blanket, asked if it was Calvin.“No, Beau,” said Erin.“Nobo?” said Paul grinning.“Beau. He said ‘mons pubis.’ Ew.”“What does that mean?”“It’s a part of the body,” said Erin with a worried expression.“You guys are seeing . . . you guys are together again?”“No, we’re not,” said Erin shaking her head. “This is, like, unacceptable behavior.”“You’re not together?”“We were . . . but then I broke up with him . . . again.”“Again? After we ate steak on your birthday?”“Yeah,” said Erin.“So . . . you got back together after that?”“Well, no, but . . . he told me he was unemployed, and all this bad stuff was happening to him, and I felt bad.”Paul made a quiet, ambiguous noise.“We’ve, like, hung out,” said Erin.“Oh,” said Paul, unsure if he was confused.“But we’re not together,” said Erin quietly, then drank a shot of tequila and most of a Four Loko (for a video she’d told someone she would post on her Tumblr) and an hour later, Paul saw after being in the bathroom a few minutes, was asleep with her mouth slightly open and her MacBook open on her stomach. After untangling a cord, then moving the MacBook to the floor, Paul lay beside Erin and meekly pawed her forearm three times, then briefly held some of her fingers, which were surprisingly warm. He lay stomach-down with his arm on her arm, thinking that if she woke, while he was asleep, this contact could be viewed as accidental. Maybe she would roll toward him, resting her arm across his back—they’d both be stomach-down, as if skydiving—in an unconscious or dream-integrated manner she wouldn’t remember, in the morning, when they’d wake in a kind of embrace and begin kissing, neither knowing who initiated, therefore brought together naturally, like plants that join at their roots. After a few motionless minutes, unable to sleep in his increasingly tense position, he rolled over and gathered a blanket into a cushiony bunch, which he held like a stuffed animal of a brain, and slept facing a wall.The next afternoon, at the University of Baltimore, in a lounge area, bright and warm from sunlight through glass panels, Paul and Erin sat on padded chairs and watched last night’s footage, which they felt was “unseemly” and decided not to edit into a video to put on YouTube. At a soup-and-sandwich restaurant, two blocks away, they discussed what movies they wanted to make—Heroin, in which they inject heroin in each other and “work on things” on their MacBooks, recording six perspectives: their faces, their MacBook screens, their positions in the lounge area (from cameras on tripods in the distance) in sunlight on separate padded seats.Cocaine, in which a third person records them going to nightclubs and bars on a Friday night in Manhattan without a plan except that they must snort cocaine every ten minutes and will carry knapsacks filled with energy drinks and fried chicken.Or Something, in which “or something” is said hundreds of times, in a montage, sometimes with context, to convey a range of meanings: a grinning Erin “luxuriating” in her lack of specificity, a zombie-like Paul “tired” of his commitment in specifying uncertainty, Erin saying “or something, or something,” earnestly to a Paul who has become “tolerant” to “or something.”—then returned to the lounge area and worked on things separately, until night, when they began texting people and asking on Facebook if anyone within fifty miles wanted to sell them drugs. Someone would walk to Erin’s car to sell her cocaine and heroin, said Beau in a text, if she parked in a specific area of a shopping plaza.“That’s like . . . I don’t know,” said Paul quietly while trying to think about why Erin had texted Beau. Erin was quiet, then said she didn’t want to try that option, then they walked four blocks to her apartment, where they used Xanax and Hydrocodone before driving to an apartment where someone had LSD, which they used with a little cough syrup. They drove to a movie theater and watched Jackass 3D, then couldn’t find an open restaurant, so decided to drive to New York City. They arrived around 8:30 a.m., to an afternoon-like morning, not hungry or tired, due to Adderall.They decided to film MDMA without a plan, except to use MDMA and go canoeing in Central Park. After showering in Paul’s apartment, then riding the L train to Union Square and using MDMA in Whole Foods, then getting off an uptown 6 train four stops early by accident, they decided to go to Times Square instead of Central Park. They rode the Ferris wheel inside Toys “R” Us, then discovered that on MDMA they could easily speak in an unspecific, aggregate parody of (1) the stereotypical “intellectual” (2) most people in movies (3) most people on TV with a focus on newscasters and National Geographic–style voice-overs. They termed this manner of speaking (almost the opposite, especially for Paul, of the quiet and literal and inflectionless voice they normally used to speak to each other) “the voice,” using it, in Barnes & Noble, with high levels of amusement and stimulation, to feign egregious ignorance, improvise seemingly expert commentary on specific objects, excessively employ academic terms and literary references.That night, at Pure Food and Wine, an organic raw vegan restaurant near Union Square, seated outside the entrance in a kind of waiting area, they each ate a psilocybin chocolate with their salads. Their plan was to attend an Asian American Writers’ Workshop fund-raiser in an art gallery, after eating, to record part one of Mushrooms. Exiting the restaurant, a woman looked down at Erin’s MacBook with an affectedly bemused expression and asked with a French accent if it was recording.“Yes,” said Erin smiling.“You are recording yourself?”“Yeah,” said Erin grinning.“That is weird, no?” said the woman, and walked away.“I feel like I hate everyone,” said Paul a few minutes later, walking toward the art gallery.“Huh?” said Erin. If she didn’t hear something, Paul had noticed, she would sometimes appear confused in a frightened, child-like way, as if having assumed she’d been insulted.“I feel like I hate everyone,” said Paul.“Yeah,” said Erin, and smiled at him.“Really?” said Paul, a little surprised.“Yeah. Well, everyone on the street.”“I feel like I can’t even look at anyone,” said Paul.They were on their sides facing each other on Paul’s mattress, in his room, dark except for moonlight, around 3:30 a.m. After the fund-raiser, at which a saxophone player had ranted about identity politics until people, after maybe six minutes, actually began booing, they’d walked aimlessly into a gallery across the street, then had eaten dinner, four blocks from Paul’s apartment, at Mesa Coyoacán. Paul scooted toward Erin, and they hugged five to ten seconds and began kissing and removing their clothes. Erin’s eyes, whenever Paul looked, seemed to be tightly closed, which seemed like “not a good sign,” as he’d read on her blog—or somewhere—that she liked sex with “a lot of eye contact.” They were sweating, and their heads were on the opposite side of the mattress from before, when they finished, after around fifty minutes.That night, in the library, Paul texted Erin, who’d left for Baltimore at 7:40 a.m. for a 12:30 p.m. public-speaking class, asking if she wanted to attend an event—Caked Up!—in two days in an art gallery, where cakes made by graphic designers,  including Paul’s brother, would be served buffet style. Paul texted it might not be worth the drive, since they would be driving eight hours the day after to Ohio, where Calvin had organized a reading and they would be staying three nights. When Erin promptly responded yes and that it wouldn’t be inconvenient, because she liked driving, Paul was surprised how relieved he felt—how disappointed he would’ve been if she had declined—and realized, with excitement and a concurrent adjustment of his default mood to “eager and patient,” that he was (or that he now, after Erin’s response, viewed himself as being) in a stable situation of mutual, increasing attraction.Their last night in Ohio, around midnight, when Calvin’s parents and three brothers and Calvin were asleep, Paul and Erin decided to drink coffee and share a 30mg Adderall and each eat a psilocybin chocolate and, in the five hours before Erin would drive Paul to the airport—Calvin had bought Paul a plane ticket a month ago, as incentive to come—film part two of Mushrooms in the mansion’s basement, which included a room with guitars and amps and a drum set, a game room with four arcade machines, a one-room gym, a billiards table, a home theater, a kitchen. They kissed for twenty minutes in the gym, then shut themselves in a room with two desktop computers and had sex for an hour in the dark, then showered together. They sat on a one-seat sofa in the living room with Erin’s MacBook on their lap. Paul asked if Erin wanted to go with him next week to North Carolina and Louisiana, where he had readings at colleges.“Yeah,” said Erin.“Are you sure?”“Yeah,” said Erin.“You’ve said yes to other things you didn’t want to do.”“Can you give me an example of one of those things?”“Smoking weed with Calvin,” said Paul about two nights ago, and extended a finger, then another finger. “Inviting Patrick to visit you,” he said about someone Erin met at the College of Coastal Georgia and had spoken to twice on Skype and exchanged mix CDs and who, by Erin’s invitation, had purchased plane tickets to visit her—for six days, in two weeks—but whose Facebook messages Erin had been ignoring. Paul closed his eyes and thought about how Erin seemed like she didn’t want to talk to Beau anymore, but continued texting him and answering his calls.“Just those two things,” said Paul, and opened his eyes.“I can explain those two things. Smoking weed with Calvin, I thought it could be a thing that I want to do, but in the moment I didn’t feel like doing. And Patrick . . . I felt, like, bored for a long time . . . with romantic prospects. It seemed exciting that this person in Georgia was interested in me. I thought ‘this could at least be something to do.’ So . . . that’s why. And I thought that maybe once he came it could be fun, or something.”“So, if it’s just something to do, you’ll still do it.”“Yeah,” said Erin with the word extended. “But that’s not what it would be like . . . with you. This,” she said, and placed a hand on Paul’s shoulder. “Interests me. A lot.”“But do I interest you enough for you to go through with it,” mumbled Paul.“With what?” said Erin after a few seconds.“To go through with it,” said Paul, unsure what he was referencing.“What? What does?”“I don’t know,” said Paul quickly. “Never mind. You want to come.”“I want to come.”“Okay,” said Paul. “Good.” They saw in Google Calendar that Erin was scheduled to work two days next week. “So . . . you’re not going with me?”“I want to,” said Erin.“But you have work.”“I’d rather go with you than work,” said Erin noncommittally.“Then . . . what are you going to do?”“I think I can get someone to cover my shifts. They don’t really need me there those days.”“What . . . are you doing?” said Paul, and grinned. “What the hell are you doing?”“I’m going with you,” said Erin grinning, and patted his shoulder. “I’m going with you.”[END OF THE TOUR] Posted by Nate at 11:12 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "E: END OF THE TOUR",
    "text": "E: END OF THE TOUR Wednesday, November 21, 2018 END OF THE TOUR In North Carolina two Duke University students drove Paul and Erin from the airport, where they’d arrived on separate flights, to a hotel, returning at night to drive them to the reading. Paul and Erin talked calmly in the dark backseat, holding half-full cups of hot tea from the hotel lobby, as a college radio station played something fuzzy and instrumental and wistful. Erin said she emailed Patrick last night, while she was in Baltimore and Paul was in Brooklyn, that she started liking someone else and was sorry if he felt bad and would help pay for his plane ticket. Paul asked if Patrick might still visit Baltimore, as a kind of vacation.“Probably not. He was going to stay in my apartment.”“What did Beau say last night?”“He just really wanted to hang out,” said Erin, who had mentioned in an email that she had “screamed” at Beau on the phone. “And I was like, ‘I don’t, really. I have other things to do and you shouldn’t be here.’ ”“He came over?”“No, he was like ‘fuck that, I’m coming over now.’ Or like ‘I’m walking there now.’ I was like ‘this is . . . scary,’ ” said Erin, and laughed.“Jesus. What did you scream at him?”“I screamed, like, ‘this is done.’ And I hung up on him.”“Did he call more after that?”“No. He sent me . . . a mean text, insulting me. He was like, ‘you’re really great, but I’ve always thought your body sucked,’ or something.”“Seems like a non sequitur.”“I know,” said Erin, and laughed. “It was weird.”“Did you respond to that?”“No,” said Erin. “He’s insane.”“Do you think you’ll talk to him again?”Erin said “probably not.” The aquarium, sparsely forested darkness outside the car, on a street sometimes half-bracketed by shopping plazas, reminded Paul of traveling at night in Florida in his family’s minivan. During longer drives he would lay alone, with a blanket and pillow, behind the third row of seats, beyond range of communication—not obligated to respond, he felt, even if he heard his name. In the dark and padded space, on his back, he’d see everything outside, reflected toward him, as one image—squiggling, watery, elemental, synthetic, holographic, layered—in fluid, representational reconfiguration of itself. Until 13 or 14, then sometimes habitually, he never sat in the front seat of cars, even if no one else was, except the five to ten times his brother, home a few weeks or months from college, would say “I’m not your chauffeur” and force Paul, who would feel immature and embarrassed, to sit in front. “I email with Michelle like once every three months,” said Paul. “But in a manner like we’re emailing every day. Like, if someone read our emails it would seem like we were emailing every day.”“That seems good,” said Erin smiling.• • •In Louisiana, two days later, Paul and Erin were in a Best Buy, early in the afternoon, to buy an external hard drive, because their MacBooks from storing their movies were almost out of memory. Paul was walking aimlessly through the store with a bored expression, holding the Smashing Pumpkins’ double CD below him, at waist level, where he scratched its plastic wrapping in an idle, distracted, privately frustrated manner. After finally tearing it off and lodging it, with difficulty, because it kept clinging to him by static electricity, behind some Beck CDs, he used “brute force,” he thought instructionally, to pry open the locked case and get only the blue CD, which had “Tonight, Tonight” and “Zero” on it, to listen to in the rental car.In Best Buy’s security room, which was module-like and dimmer than the store, the sheriff of Baton Rouge shook his head in strong, earnest, remarkably unjaded disappointment when Paul, asked why he was here—he had a Florida driver’s license, a New York address—said a college had invited him to speak to them, as an author.“I felt ashamed,” said Paul in the parking lot to Erin. “I feel like I was on shoplifting autopilot. I wasn’t thinking anything. I was just already doing it.” In Barnes & Noble, a few hours later, he stole Nirvana’s second “greatest hits” collection. They ate watermelon and pineapple chunks in Whole Foods, then drove downtown and rode an elevator to the sixth floor of a darkly tinted building, where Paul read to LSU’s graduate writing program for around twenty minutes (“from a memoir-in-progress that’ll be more than a thousand pages,” he said half earnestly) about a night he watched Robin Hood with Daniel at the Union Square theater, then went to a pizza restaurant, where Fran, who had whiskey in a Dr Pepper bottle, got drunker than Paul had ever seen her  and the next day quit her job, after two days, as a waitress in a Polish restaurant. Paul felt self-conscious whenever mentioning a drug, in part because none of his previous books had drugs—except caffeine, alcohol, Tylenol Cold, St. John’s wort—but the audience laughed almost every time a drug was mentioned, seeming delighted, like most of them were on drugs, which was probably true, Paul thought while reading off his MacBook screen. He imagined stopping what he was reading to instead say “Klonopin,” wait three seconds, say “Xanax,” wait three seconds, etc. He didn’t notice until the word “concealment” that he was reading a sentence from something else he’d been working on that had been pasted apparently into the wrong file. He continued reading the sentence—The transparency and total effort, with none spent on explanation or concealment or experimentation, of what the universe desired—to hug itself as carefully, as violently and patiently, as had been exactly decided upon, at some point, with gravity—was [something].—until getting to “[something],” which he remembered using as a placeholder after trying combinations of synonyms for “affecting” and “confusing” and longer descriptions like “an actualized ideal, inside of which any combination of parts could never independently attain.” He stared at “[something]” and thought about saying “Klonopin” or “Xanax.” He thought about explaining the bracket usage. “The sentence I just read wasn’t supposed to be there,” he said. “I pasted it there by accident, I think. I’ll stop here, thank you.”He sat next to Erin in the front row, then Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, a woman in her 60s, whose introduction included that she was married to Richard Tuttle—the artist Gabby said Daniel resembled—read poems for thirty minutes.• • •At a flea market, the next afternoon, after drinking the equivalent of six to eight cups of coffee—in the form of 24x condensed coffee, which they bought from Whole Foods and had never seen before, in containers reminiscent of toilet-cleaning liquid—they pretended to be Wall Street Journal reporters and recorded themselves interviewing strangers about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Erin meekly asked a large, young, thuggish-looking man and his smaller friend, both wearing backward caps, if they thought Darth Vader would “die in this one.” After a long pause the large man laughed and said “man, I don’t know,” and looked at his friend, who appeared expressionless, like he hadn’t heard anything that had been said.“Darth Vader is Star Trek, not Harry Potter,” said Paul in a weak form of the “the voice,” feigning he was remembering this aloud.“No, no,” said Erin grinning. “Really?”“Star Wars,” said Paul laughing a little.“Oh, I don’t know, never mind, never mind, I need to check my notes,” said Erin shaking her head and grinning as she and Paul walked away mumbling to each other, attempting to parody, Paul felt, a stereotypical comedy in which two high-level professionals are egregiously demoted into positions where they struggle to regain their jobs while nurturing between them an unlikely romance and mutually learning the true meaning in life. Erin said she felt “a strong need to be on more drugs.” Without MDMA it was difficult to use “the voice,” without which they felt uncomfortable talking to strangers, improvising, feigning behavior, trying to be witty.• • •After ingesting their remaining Xanax, and more condensed coffee, they decided to drive to New Orleans, an hour away, because their flight to New York, from Baton Rouge, wasn’t until the next morning. It became dark suddenly, it seemed, during the drive. Erin expressed concern about Paul’s driving speed in residential-seeming areas. Paul encouraged her to nap (they’d both said they were sleepy, due to Xanax) and said he would be careful and, a vague amount of time later, became aware of a car that was parked, for some reason, on the street. After a few seconds of vague, unexamined confusion Paul realized the car, in the near distance, was stopped at a red light and abruptly braked hard, then harder, curling his toes with a sensation of clenching a fist. The screeching noise and forward thrust startled Erin awake, but she remained silent, seeming mostly confused. Paul drove sheep-ishly into a shopping plaza and parked near the middle of the mostly empty parking lot and turned off the car.“I started feeling anxious before like where were we going and we were going fast and it was dark and you were running into things a little bit and I was scared and anxious and afraid,” said Erin in one breath of wildly fluctuating volume and inflection and affect that seemed out of control and arbitrary, then in retrospect like she’d virtuosically sung a popular melody faster than anyone had ever considered trying.“Sorry,” said Paul with a worried expression.“And I felt scared,” said Erin with a slight tremble.“Sorry,” said Paul. “I’m really sorry.” After he apologized more times they walked holding hands across the parking lot. Erin said she only felt slightly interrupted when she woke, that she had been like, “wait, I don’t care, right now, about dying, but in the future I might not want to die.” In a confused, intrigued voice Paul said “in . . . the future?”“In the future I’ll—” said Erin.“But if you’re dead you’ll be dead,” said Paul in a loud, murmurred, strangely incredulous voice that he felt aversion toward and confused by.“What?”“But if you’re dead you’ll die,” mumbled Paul in a quieter, slurred voice like a stroke victim.“But I didn’t really want to die right then,” said Erin.Around midnight, on the drive back to Baton Rouge, Erin said her father seemed to enjoy giving her Xanax and Adderall and that she used to get angry at him for smoking marijuana every night because it affected his memory and he would repeat himself—and, if stopped, would become defensive, argumentative—but now she didn’t try to change him anymore. Paul said his father’s default name for him, what he’d unconsciously say to get Paul’s attention or to reference Paul in conversation, was “baby” until high school, or maybe college, when it became “old baby”—in Taiwanese, where both words were one syllable—which was what he now called almost all people and animals. Paul and Erin were walking near Bobst Library, a week and a half later, on a significantly colder night, in a sleet-like drizzle, when one of them said they wished it were warm and the other said they should fly somewhere warm. Las Vegas was the first suggestion. Paul said he wanted to lose all his money—around $1,200—while “peaking on MDMA” after eating at a buffet and relaxing in a hot tub.In Think Coffee, an hour later, using Erin’s MacBook, they bought a package deal for two round-trip flights and a rental car and four nights at the Tropicana, leaving on November 26, in five days.[MARRY] Posted by Nate at 11:18 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "E: MARRY",
    "text": "E: MARRY Wednesday, November 21, 2018 MARRY “This is what the universe created, after whatever billion years,” said Paul gesturing at MGM Grand and Excalibur and Luxor, around 9:30 p.m., on a walkway above the main street of casinos in Las Vegas, which was as cold or colder than New York City, they’d learned, with some amusement, upon arriving four hours ago.“This is what we came into,” said Erin.“Look, beautiful,” said Paul earnestly about the hundreds of red lights on the backs of cars, passing beneath the walk-way, into the distance, like rubies in a mining operation.“Whoa. Pretty.”“Life sometimes offers beautiful images,” said Paul in a voice like he was in fifth grade reading a textbook aloud.“But they’re fleeting.”“Yeah,” said Paul grinning.“And you can’t do anything with them—”“Yeah,” said Paul.“—except look at them,” said Erin.“Maybe we should get drunk,” said Paul, and they entered the casino at the end of the walkway, and Erin went to the bathroom. Paul sat at a slot machine and lost $20, then stared at two middle-aged men wearing backward caps, holding full glasses of golden beer, as they approached and passed with determined, unhappy expressions. When Erin returned, a few minutes later, she said “I think I feel depleted.”“What do you mean?”“I feel kind of tired, depleted.”“But you shouldn’t even have started feeling it yet.”“Huh?” said Erin. “We had MDMA like twenty minutes ago.”Erin laughed. “I forgot.”“Jesus. You scared me.”“Sorry,” said Erin grinning, and they sat on the floor of a carpeted hallway—darkly lit from an unseen source that cyclically pulsed from a near-ultraviolet purple to dark red—positioning Erin’s MacBook to record themselves talking about their relationship.“You go,” said Paul smiling widely. “You go first.”“Okay, um, well I felt like I first wanted to kiss you when I dropped you off at the airport,” said Erin quickly, with a stricken expression, as if confessing something intensely shameful.“At the airport? After Denny’s?”“Yeah,” said Erin. “I wanted to kiss you then.”“I thought you were hugging me really hard.”“Uh, I thought you were hugging me hard,” said Erin seeming frightened, then for around five seconds didn’t breathe. Paul laughed, in confusion. Erin said she felt a little nervous. Paul asked if she thought they were going to have sex, when they kissed, on his bed. Erin said no, that she just kept thinking things like “what’s happening?” and “are we really going to do it?” Paul said he thought yes, because they wouldn’t have been able to stop, except by finishing, because neither of them had said no to anything yet.“We still haven’t,” said Paul. “Right?”“Um,” said Erin. “Yeah, I think.”“There was a period of like three days when I was really obsessed with you. But you weren’t responding to my email and I kind of lost the obsessive nature.”“Whoa,” said Erin. “When?”“After one of the first times we hung out. We were sending picture messages, then you stopped and didn’t email and I felt really depressed.”“Damn. Sorry. I didn’t know.”“What was going on then?”“I was kind of seeing Beau still then,” said Erin, and as the MDMA took effect Paul began using “the voice” sometimes, including when Erin asked him which of his previous girlfriends he felt closest to and he said “I’m not really sure” in an extreme parody of a stereotypical romantic comedy, and they laughed for maybe ten seconds. Paul had stopped using “the voice,” an hour later, when, during a silence, Erin asked what he was thinking and he said he was thinking why she hadn’t read or mentioned the first-person account of his life from April to July he had emailed her a few weeks ago, at her request, which had, to some degree, been obligatory, he knew. Erin said she felt strange reading about Paul’s romantic interest in other people while she was beginning a relationship with him. “Like, I felt jealous,” she said. “Of the Laura person, reading about her.”“That makes sense,” said Paul earnestly.“I also felt a little strange reading about your friendship with Daniel. I was like ‘whoa, they could hang out a lot, then just not anymore; damn, what if that happens with me?’ ”“Daniel was really interested in how Kyle and I just stopped talking,” said Paul.“Then you and Daniel stopped talking.”“You don’t feel fine with that?”“I do . . . I feel fine with that. I just think of all possible situations going into something . . . positive or negative. Does that make sense?”“Yeah,” said Paul nodding. “When I first met Michelle I was telling her that I’ve had a lot of friends who I’ve just stopped talking to, and she said she was afraid I would do that to her.”“That seems to be what happens with people.”“You don’t have to read it at all,” said Paul.“Okay,” said Erin.“I trust whatever reasons you have . . . for doing anything,” said Paul, and wondered if he had felt this before, or if he already no longer felt it.The next night, after buying watermelon and salad ingredients from Whole Foods, they couldn’t find a parking spot at the Tropicana, then found one in a different area and walked a different route toward their room. Paul noticed a MARRIAGE CHAPEL sign at the end of the hallway and, after a few seconds, as they approached it silently, said “we should get married.”“I was going to say that,” said Erin.“I would get married to you.”“Me too,” said Erin. “To you.”“Let’s get married.”“Let’s do it tomorrow.”“Okay,” said Paul. “I’m confirmed.”In Whole Foods, the next afternoon, Erin emailed her manager at the used bookstore that she was quitting her job, then scrolled through photos of Elvis standing between grinning, newlywed couples. Elvis appeared more energetic and alive than the couples in almost every photo, including one in which the couple was partially blocked from view by an over-eager Elvis who seemed to have lunged toward the camera, displaying the knuckles side of a peace sign.“I don’t get it, at all,” said Paul.“It’s what people do. This is what people want.”“It really seems insane,” said Paul.“People are insane,” said Erin.“We should get an Elvis wedding.”“I’m fine with an Elvis wedding.”“Actually, I don’t want an Elvis wedding,” said Paul. “It seems extremely stressful.” Erin made a next-day reservation for a “desk wedding.” They discussed if they wanted to be on MDMA during their marriage ceremony. Erin said they should save it for the day after tomorrow, their last in Las Vegas.“We might be dead by then,” said Paul.“They won’t let us get married if we’re on drugs,” said Erin.“They’ll think we’re on drugs if we’re not on drugs. We’re normal when we’re on drugs.”Erin laughed weakly.“We’ll just—” said Paul. “We’ll figure it out.”“We’re going to be driving after the wedding, let’s just do it after we drive,” said Erin a few minutes later in a slightly pleading tone.“Okay, okay,” said Paul earnestly while nodding and patting her shoulder, then hugged her briefly.Across the street from the marriage license office was a billboard that said MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE about used cars and used car parts. In the office, which was bright and quiet and arranged like a post office, while filling out forms, Paul said getting married was like getting a tattoo, in that he just wanted to pay money and receive a service, not make appointments and go places and talk to strangers and be asked to confirm his choice. Erin said she was thinking that also and had been “having the same feeling” as before she got tattoos. Paul noticed a sign that said intoxicated applicants would be TURNED AWAY and focused, as they approached the window, on appearing normal, but realized he didn’t know how.“Look at the helpers,” he said pointing at six to ten clips, each clasping an impressive seeming amount of paper, magnetized to the side of a cabinet. “I want one.”“Me too,” said Erin grinning. “Which one do you want?”“Any of them,” said Paul after a few seconds.“I want the curvy one,” said Erin.Paul stared at the identical, brown clips.“The guy with the stripes,” said Erin. “My own ‘underling.’ ”“I’m talking about the plastic paper holder things,” said Paul.• • •Walking to their rental car they saw a shiny building and an abandoned building side by side, in the near distance. Paul expressed amazement at this second, also obvious, though maybe less egregious metaphor—the first being the used car billboard—and said their marriage would resemble the abandoned building in five years. After a pause, which functioned unintentionally for comic effect, he said “or, like, five days.”Erin laughed. “Five months, maybe,” she said earnestly.“Yeah,” said Paul thinking that of the fives—hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades—months was, by far, most likely. “We’ll be that tree,” he said pointing at a tree that appeared healthy and, he thought, dignified.“The apartments for rent,” said Erin.“The tree,” said Paul.“Yeah, the tree.”“The tree seems good.”“Nature. Natural.”“Jesus, look,” said Paul pointing at an eerie building far in the distance, thin and black, like a cursor on the screen of a computer that had become unresponsive. He imagined building-size letters suddenly appearing, left to right, in a rush—wpkjgijfhtetiukgcnlm—across the desert.The marriage chapel was less than a mile away in a building containing four to six businesses. Paul sat on a two-seat sofa, in a sort of hallway, while Erin used the bathroom. Around ten people, mostly children, surrounding what appeared to be a newlywed couple, passed through Paul’s vision, on their way out of the building, then Erin sat by him, then the pastor (a large man with white hair and a serious but friendly demeanor) sat behind a tiny desk (six feet away, at the opposite wall) and read a prepared statement, completing the  marriage, at which point—coincidentally, it seemed—a door opened and a smiling woman, with a tiny dog at her feet, congratulated Paul and Erin, after which, sort of huddled against each other, they moved toward the exit grinning.“I immediately thought ‘fuck you’ to the stranger congratulating us,” said Paul outside, on a sidewalk. Erin laughed and said she thought “pop-up ad,” because “it went through the door,” and they hugged and jumped repeatedly as one mass, spinning a little and sometimes saying “we did it” quietly. Paul ran suddenly away, onto the parking lot, in a wide arc that curved eventually toward the rental car in a centripetal force, accelerating to a speed that was, at this point in his life, unfamiliarly fast, but not near maximum, before slowing, as he neared the passenger door—and, knowing he would not collide with the car, briefly aware of the dream-like amount of control he had over his body—to a stop.In Erin’s car, two weeks later, on the way to Brooklyn—from Baltimore, where the past two nights he separately met Erin’s parents, who were married but lived apart—Paul texted two drug dealers, Android and Peanut, to buy MDMA, ecstasy, LSD, cocaine to have in Taiwan, where they were going in the morning. Paul’s parents had invited Paul and Erin to stay with them, as a kind of wedding present, all expenses paid including plane tickets, December 13 to January 2. The marriage, without which Paul likely would not be visiting Taiwan this year, seemed also to have drastically improved his relationship with his mother, who hadn’t mentioned drugs, at all, the past three weeks, now that she had something positive to focus on and nurture.It was dark out and neither drug dealer had responded, after two hours, when they arrived in Brooklyn and parked by Khim’s. After buying lemons, celery, kale, apples, energy  drinks, toilet paper they walked six blocks to Paul’s apartment, then within ten minutes both drug dealers—and Paul’s brother, to give Paul a Christmas present and presents to bring to their parents—texted that they were on their way. Android, named after the smartphone, Paul assumed, arrived first. Paul went outside, past the bronze gate, into Android’s expensive-seeming car.“How’s it going? You all right?”“Yeah, good. How are you?”“I’m good,” said Android.“Here’s $230,” said Paul, and Android transferred a vial of cocaine and a tiny baggie of capsules into Paul’s left hand. Paul asked if the MDMA was from the same batch as last time. Android said they were and, after a pause, in a voice subtly indicating auspiciousness due to rarity and increased quality, added that they were “double-dipped.” Paul visualized a stock image, composite from movies he’d seen, of ethnic workers apportioning powder into capsules. “Oh, good,” he said, and hesitated, then asked what “double-dipped” meant. Android, in response, seemed to shutdown, as a person, into a dormant state; when, after maybe two seconds, he returned to functioning, he seemed uncharacteristically bored and inattentive, like he wanted to be alone. “They do it twice . . . it goes through once, and they dip it again,” he said unenthusiastically, with unfocused eyes and a subtle movement of his upper body that somehow effectively conveyed an additional, unrequired action within the process of an assembly line.“Nice,” said Paul. “Thank you for driving here.”“No problem,” said Android in his normal voice. “Give me a call if you want some stuff over the holidays.”“We did it,” said Paul in a monotone to Erin in his room, and they hugged. Peanut texted he was ten minutes away. Paul read a text from his brother and went outside and opened the bronze gate. Paul’s brother followed Paul into the house, where Erin stood in the hallway outside Paul’s apartment.“Erin, right? Nice to finally meet you.”“Nice to meet you too,” said Erin.After a pause, during which they all grinned at one another, Paul’s brother gave Paul a duffel bag and a check and, due to pressure from their mother, Paul assumed, a winter coat, and said “this is for Mom and Dad, you have to remember to give it to them,” indicating a department store bag inside the duffel bag.“Okay,” said Paul looking in the duffel bag.“You have to remember.”“I will,” said Paul.“You can’t forget. Okay?”“I won’t,” said Paul.“Okay,” said Paul’s brother in a slightly child-like voice, then looked at a vacantly grinning Erin and hastily said “we’ll have a formal dinner later on together, all of us,” with a scrunched expression conveying he knew that she obviously already knew this information, which he was saying aloud as a kind of indulgence to himself. Peanut texted five minutes later when Paul was sitting on his yoga mat, absently organizing his drugs in his six-compartment plastic container.Paul got in the backseat of a car that, relative to Android’s, did not seem expensive. The same middle-aged woman as the previous four or five times Paul bought from Peanut, the past few months, was driving. Paul distractedly imagined himself asking if the woman was Peanut’s mother as he bought two strips of LSD and thirty ecstasy—half blue, half red—from Peanut, who was in the front passenger seat.Paul and Erin, sitting on Paul’s mattress, were wearing earphones and doing things on their MacBooks, an hour later, after each ingesting “double-dipped” capsules of MDMA and 10mg Adderall and sharing a zero-calorie energy drink. They’d decided to use drugs throughout the night and sleep on the plane. Paul, worried because he didn’t feel like talking even after the MDMA and Adderall should’ve taken effect, inspected the capsules and asked Erin on Gmail chat if they seemed less full than in the past; they didn’t, to her, but she also wasn’t feeling a strong effect. They concluded the problem was their tolerance levels and each ingested a blue ecstasy and continued doing things separately. “I feel something now, but I’m not sure if I feel like talking,” thought Paul looking at his Gmail account. “But I think I’ll be okay.”The next four hours they had sex (and showered) three times, shared 50oz kale-celery-apple-lemon juice and 30mg Adderall, typed accounts of a cold and sunny afternoon one week ago when they walked around SoHo on MDMA shouting and screaming iterations of Charles’ name (initials, first, first and last, full) at each other while holding hands. Paul packaged a strip of LSD, four MDMA, twelve ecstasy inside the CD case for Nirvana’s second “greatest hits” album, which he wrapped in transparent tape, then in four issues of Seattle’s leading alt weekly with his face on the cover, which his mother had requested he bring, then in a shirt, which he fit snugly inside a shoebox.Around 4:30 a.m., after deciding to use all their cocaine before leaving for the airport, they recorded Erin licking cocaine off Paul’s testicles and serving cocaine off an iPhone to Paul reading a purple-covered Siddhartha while seated on a high chair he found on a sidewalk in August and until now had used only as a clothing rack; Erin snorting cocaine off her MacBook screen; Paul snorting cocaine off Erin’s face; both snorting cocaine off vacuum-wrapped Omaha Steaks, which Calvin’s father had ordered for Paul for Thanksgiving. They discussed, relative to Adderall, not liking cocaine, which was  inferior in price, effect, length of effect, after effect, convenience, availability but fun to have in group situations, in terms of thinking of funny places to snort it from. Paul said he wanted to shower before finishing the cocaine and walking to Variety, a café four blocks away, to relax, drink iced coffee, wait for their airport taxi.After showering Paul dried himself and put on clothes and, while Erin was showering, stood in a corner and stared at his room without thinking anything or, he realized after a vague amount of time, moving his eyeballs. He sat on his yoga mat and stared at his Gmail account, remembering after a few minutes that he’d wanted to stand in a corner and look at his room to double-check he’d packed everything. When Erin, looking at herself in the wall mirror, finished blow-drying her hair, around fifteen minutes later, Paul looked up from where he’d remained on his yoga mat—absently scrolling through bohemianism’s Wikipedia page after clicking “bohemian” on Kurt Cobain’s page, which he’d looked at, while rereading emails from his mother, to see if he died at 26 or 27—and asked if Erin was “ready,” with what felt like a self-consciously neutral expression, vaguely sensing his question to be antagonistic, because he didn’t know exactly what it referenced.“Yeah,” said Erin with a blank expression.“No,” said Paul pointing at her MacBook and small pile of miscellany by her red backpack, which he felt aversion toward, in a manner that would become a problem, for him, in the future, he realized, with aversion toward himself, because it always seemed dirty.“What,” said Erin.“You’re not finished packing.”“I thought we were doing that first?” said Erin pointing at the cocaine.Paul felt himself blinking. “Oh,” he said. “Yeah. I forgot. Sorry.” He stood and stepped carefully over his yoga mat and kneeled by the low table and asked with unfocused eyes and a controlled voice if Erin wanted to use the remaining cocaine at Variety—to extend their usage and, he vaguely thought, soften their forthcoming “depletion,” or “depleted serotonin levels,” as they had, with a kind of feigned affection, been referencing their periods, after feeling good on drugs, of feeling bad.“Okay,” said Erin after a pause. “But we should cut it first.”“We can do it there,” said Paul after a long pause.“It’ll be easier to do it here,” said Erin.Paul stared at her tired, confident expression.“I don’t want to do it there,” she said.“Okay. But we’ll have to put it back in, after taking it out, if we do it here. We have to take it out and put it all back in again.”“That’s fine. We aren’t in a hurry . . . are we?”“No,” said Paul after a few seconds, and heard himself thinking, in a voice like he was practicing a speech, that an amount, even if only a trace, of cocaine would remain outside the vial—and it would all just clump together again, when back inside. There was also the risk of sneezing or otherwise uncontrollably disrupting the cocaine. “But we’ll lose some, when you take it out,” he said slowly. “It just . . . seems inconvenient.” Erin said she could “cut it really fast” and that she’d done it many times, arguably referencing, for the second or third time, a somewhat mysterious period of her life, when she did cocaine with Beau and other people every night or something. Paul felt aversion toward himself for feeling bothered by how Erin, or the situation itself, seemed to be indicating that, by not defaulting to Erin’s greater experience in cutting cocaine, Paul was behaving irrationally. “It just seems inconvenient,” he was saying. “It’s just inconvenient.”“We can cut it there,” said Erin with a bored expression. “It doesn’t really matter.”“We’ll just cut it here,” said Paul, and slowly swiveled his head toward the cocaine. He grasped the cute, orange-capped vial with the thumb and middle finger of his right hand, whose full weight rested on the table. “I don’t care about cutting it. When we put it back in, won’t it, just, like, turn into a clump again?”“We don’t have to,” said Erin. “I don’t really care.”“Why cut it, though? Doesn’t it all just go in you?”“It doesn’t hurt as much,” said Erin, and gestured at the top half of her face and said things about sinuses, that it was “healthier” and that “more of it gets absorbed, instead of going in your stomach,” as Paul thought about referencing Cocaine: A Drug and Its Social Evolution, a book he knew Erin knew he’d been reading. “It all gets absorbed,” he said. “It’s the same if you eat it or snort it.”“Then why does everyone snort it,” said Erin seeming neither curious nor rhetorical.“People do a lot of things. I don’t know why, probably a lot of reasons. It’s the same as long as it’s inside of you. I read the book. The cocaine book.”“That’s true,” said Erin.“So, you should listen to me,” said Paul grinning slightly.“The book said it’s the same if you eat it?”“Yeah, or something,” mumbled Paul looking away. “I don’t remember what it said.”“What else did the book say?”“A lot of things. I don’t know. I haven’t finished it yet. I’m going to pee.” Paul stood grinning and went in the bathroom and peed a little. He splashed water onto his face. He dried his face with a hand towel and entered his room. “That was our first ‘drug fight,’ ” he said still grinning a little.“I was going to say that,” said Erin.“I feel like we handled it well.”“It was good,” said Erin absently.“I tried using the book,” said Paul grinning. “The cocaine book.”“I noticed,” said Erin with a neutral expression.At Variety, after snorting the remaining cocaine in Paul’s room, they decided to type accounts of their “drug fight.” Paul finished and left for Union Square to mail drugs to Taiwan. The shoebox, on his lap, felt “like a cat,” he kept thinking on the L train. He walked in a distended circle, like a comet’s orbit, on the wide sidewalk outside FedEx, which at 7:54 a.m. was locked and dark, listening to music through earphones, until an employee, seeming to slightly feign, Paul felt, being rushed, unlocked the door and entered and turned on the lights. Paul’s package would cost $89 to mail, said the employee, then walked out of view, toward the back of the store. Paul slowly filled out a form, then carried the form toward the exit, stood uncertainly in place a few seconds, returned to the counter, walked distractedly toward the exit, put the form in the trash, left FedEx. He rode the L train five stops. He bought two containers of pineapple chunks from a deli. “It would’ve cost $89 to mail,” he said at Variety. “I’m just going to put it in my bag. If I go to jail I’ll just write Infinite Witz,” he said referencing two very long novels, Infinite Jest and Witz.“What?” said Erin with an inattentive expression.“If I go to jail I’ll just focus on writing Infinite Witz,” said Paul, and in the time and location of waiting, for himself to repeat what he’d said, he imagined the scenario and was a little surprised at the ease and speed with which he felt he would accept it—and that he would be relieved, to be removed from the confusing, omnidirectional hierarchy of his life. Erin smiled and said “good” and patted his shoulder, and he felt surprised again, as he hugged her, realizing that he  wouldn’t be removed from his life—only dying would remove him—so would feel the same probably. He would still be—and be inside—the invulnerable dot of himself, irreducible and unique as a prime number, on or off, there or not, always following itself perfectly. Paul pushed the shoebox toward the bottom of his duffel bag, wedging it between layers of clothing, and they read each other’s “drug fight” accounts while eating pineapple chunks.“We both wrote it in a Raymond Carver–esque manner.”“I was thinking that,” said Erin. “The story with the baby.”In the taxi, at one side of the backseat, Paul felt surreally distant from Erin, at the other side, like he would need to turn his head more than 90 degrees to see her. Through the window, against his face, the early-morning light had the vertical glare and the accumulated, citrus heat of a late-afternoon sun. “I feel really depleted, I’m closing my eyes until we get there,” said Paul in a voice that was agitatedly boring for himself to speak and hear and that seemed to echo inside his mouth, staying where it began.At the airport, when they got out of the taxi, Erin asked how Paul felt and he murmured “zombie-like” without moving his head. They held hands while standing in line for luggage check-in, but Paul avoided looking at Erin, facing away from her as much as possible, to try to convey, without speaking, that he did not want to be asked any more questions, be looked at, or otherwise feel pressured to do or think anything. Unsure if Erin, at whatever moment, was receiving his communication, or not, or to what degree she was, or was not, Paul felt a constant dread of what might happen next, mostly that Erin might ask him another question. He wanted to hide by shrinking past zero, through the dot at the end of himself, to a negative size, into an otherworld, where he would find a place—in an enormous city, too large to know itself, or some slowly developing suburb—to be alone and carefully build a life in which he might be able to begin, at some point, to think about what to do about himself.They lay on their backs on a padded seat continuously lining one side of a cafeteria with no restaurants open yet. When Paul woke, drooling a little, he moved into a sitting position with his elbows on a table, and saw that Erin was gone. Before forming any thoughts, or discerning any feelings, he saw her, in the distance, outside the cafeteria, walking parallel to a moving walkway with her iPhone to her ear, becoming out of view. Paul noticed a scrap of paper on his lap, from Erin, saying she was going to the bathroom and calling her friend and would be back by 9:15 a.m. Paul saw her at 9:08 a.m. hurriedly enter a store outside the cafeteria. She approached with pineapple chunks and bottled water, smiling at Paul’s neutral expression. “I got you this,” she said, and Paul mutely held the container of pineapple chunks a few seconds before placing it distractedly on the table.“Where did you go?” said Paul self-consciously.“I went to the bathroom and called my friend Jennika. Did you see my note?”“I didn’t until like five minutes after I woke,” said Paul with aversion toward himself, aware he saw the note within a minute maybe. He asked why Erin didn’t stay within view to talk on the phone. Erin said she hadn’t thought of that and Paul said it was okay and—finally, self-conscious at the delay—thanked her for the pineapple chunks and opened the container and moved a chunk, with a fork, toward Erin’s mouth. Erin shook her head. Paul moved the chunk into his mouth and, after his mouth stopped moving, asked what Erin talked to Jennika about on the phone.“I told her I got married and was going to Taiwan, and she got angry and just started sobbing and yelling at me,” said Erin, and without noticeable change in her slack posture, facing the empty cafeteria, began crying a little. Paul carefully held her—weakly, tiredly “hating himself,” he felt—and, after she stopped crying, asked why Jennika had been angry. “She was angry I didn’t tell her sooner. She kept saying she would never do that to me and that I was a bad friend.”Paul continued asking questions and was slightly affected by Erin’s extrasensitivity, it seemed, in not relating unsolicited information. Erin said Jennika had previously always been okay with periods without contact—with respecting the other person’s availability—and that after Jennika she had called her mother to say she felt scared that Paul didn’t want her to go to Taiwan with him.“Why do you think that?”“I started feeling paranoid. I felt like you didn’t want me around and I’m bothering you just by being around.”“No,” said Paul shaking his head.“You’ve been so quiet,” said Erin.“I’m quiet from being depleted. I said I felt zombie-like.”“I know, but I still felt paranoid. I thought ‘what if he’s just tolerating me. I’m going to be around him for the next three weeks.’ And things like that.”“We’re depleted big-time. Don’t trust what you feel now.”“I felt all this even after factoring in depletion,” said Erin, and Paul eased her into a lying position, on her side with her head on his lap, and alternated feeding her and himself pineapple chunks.On the fully booked, thirteen-hour twenty-nine-minute flight to Narita, where they would transfer to a three-hour fifteen-minute flight to Taiwan, they had middle seats in consecutive, three-seat rows. Before takeoff, standing in view of the four relevant passengers, Erin asked if “anyone” wanted to trade seats for $40 so she could sit with her husband and was egregiously ignored except by the middle-aged woman, to Paul’s left, who said “no thanks” cheerfully, as if she’d misconstrued the situation to believe she was doing a favor by declining. Paul sometimes stood to lean forward and hug Erin’s head, massage her shoulders, or grin at her after certain lines of dialogue during Eat, Pray, Love, which they excitedly agreed to watch together and both felt nearly continuously amused by.After the movie they stood hugging by the “lavatories.” Erin said she felt better than when she’d been paranoid, but seemed reluctant to reciprocate Paul’s enthusiasm when, with a child-like sensation of wanting to be encouraged to believe a fantasy, or that an aberration was the norm, he said, for the third time since getting on the plane, as if stressing the unexpected discovery of something worth living for, in an existence in which most things were endured, not enjoyed, that it seemed good they used “all those drugs and energy drinks” and hadn’t slept and still felt “okay.” Paul was surprised and confused when it occurred to him that if they felt almost anything other than happy, or at least content, Eat, Pray, Love (with its montages and fortune cookie–like monks and unacknowledged but knowing, it had seemed, usage of clichés) would’ve been incredibly depressing. He felt self-consciously, annoyingly optimistic when Erin reacted to this information, which had felt to him like an epiphany, with little interest and no enthusiasm, seeming less glad or curious than troubled, as if the message was to retroactively not enjoy the movie.Before the last time Paul visited his parents (which had been his first time in Taiwan in almost five years, during which most of the Taipei Metro, or Mass Rapid Transit, had been completed) he had no concept of Taipei’s size or shape or layout, only an unreliable memory of how many minutes by car separated certain relatives’ apartments and department stores. After using the MRT and idly studying its maps on station walls and Wikipedia, then walking between stations—to and from different routes, one night to six continuous stops, some days while far from his parents’ apartment to illuminate a distant area, placing a candle there for perspective, or as a reminder that there was more—he had, with increasing interest, begun to view and internalize Taipei less like a city than its own world, which he could leisurely explore, he imagined, for years, or maybe indefinitely, as it reconfigured and continued to expand, opening new MRT stations until 2018, according to Wikipedia.To Paul, who’d stayed mostly in his uncle’s sixteenth-floor apartment on previous visits, the vaguely tropical, consummating murmur of Taipei, from his parent’s fourteenth-floor apartment, had sounded immediately and distinctively familiar. The muffled roar of traffic, hazily embellished with beeps and honks and motorcycle engines and the occasional, looping, Doppler-effected jingle from a commercial or political vehicle—had been mnemonic enough (reminding Paul of the 10 to 15 percent of his life on the opposite side of Earth, with a recurring cast of characters and no school and a different language, almost fantastically unlike the other 85 to 90 percent, in suburban Florida) for him to believe, on some level, that if a place existed where he could go to scramble some initial momentum, to disable a setting implemented before birth, or disrupt the out-of-control formation of some incomprehensible worldview, and allow a kind of settling, over time, to occur—like a spaceship that has exhausted its fuel and begun falling toward the nearest star, approaching what it wants at the rate it’s wanted, then easing into the prolonged, perfectly requited appreciation of an orbit—it would be here.

    "title": "E: TAIPEI",
    "text": "E: TAIPEI Wednesday, November 21, 2018 TAIPEI Paul’s father looked the same as last year, Paul thought at the airport, except maybe, as part of a long-term change, a little more child-like, in his mindfully cheerful manner, seeming always slightly distracted by some earnest, interior activity, which Paul sometimes imagined to be the low-level focus required to retain the mysterious, untransferable, necessarily private wisdom that powered his contentment. Paul thought of how, as one aged, more people became comparatively younger, so that, among an increasingly child-like population, one might unconsciously behave more like a child. While  buying bus tickets, then waiting for the bus, Paul’s father said he had found Paul’s Taiwanese publisher on the internet and called them—learning it was one person, in his apartment—and arranged for Paul to give a reading for the Taiwanese edition of his first novel on Christmas, its release date.On the bus Erin slept with her head on Paul’s lap. Paul’s father slept one row behind. It was around 10:30 p.m. Paul stared at the lighted signs, some of which were animated and repeating like GIF files, attached to almost every building to face oncoming traffic—from two-square rectangles like tiny wings to long strips like impressive Scrabble words but with each square a word, maybe too much information to convey to drivers—and sleepily thought of how technology was no longer the source of wonderment and possibility it had been when, for example, he learned as a child at Epcot Center, Disney’s future-themed “amusement park,” that families of three, with one or two robot dogs and one robot maid, would live in self-sustaining, underwater, glass spheres by something like 2004 or 2008. At some point, Paul vaguely realized, technology had begun for him to mostly only indicate the inevitability and vicinity of nothingness. Instead of postponing death by releasing nanobots into the bloodstream to fix things faster than they deteriorated, implanting little computers into people’s brains, or other methods Paul had probably read about on Wikipedia, until it became the distant, shrinking, nearly nonexistent somethingness that was currently life—and life, for immortal humans, became the predominate distraction that was currently death—technology seemed more likely to permanently eliminate life by uncontrollably fulfilling its only function: to indiscriminately convert matter, animate or inanimate, into computerized matter, for the sole purpose, it seemed, of increased functioning, until the universe was one computer. Technology, an abstraction, undetectable in concrete reality, was accomplishing its concrete task, Paul dimly intuited while idly petting Erin’s hair, by way of an increasingly committed and multiplying workforce of humans, who receive, over hundreds of generations, a certain kind of advancement (from feet to bicycles to cars, faces to bulletin boards to the internet) in exchange for converting a sufficient amount of matter into computerized matter for computers to be able to build themselves.As the bus moved into denser parts of Taipei, nearing Paul’s parents’ apartment building, Paul felt like he could almost sense the computerization that was happening in this area of the universe, on Earth—could imagine the three- or four-minute simulation, in a documentary that probably existed, of occurrence and eventual, omnidirectional expansion, converting asteroids and rays and stars, then galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as they became elapsed in space, into more of itself. Paul had read about this in high school, lying on the carpet in his room, in The End of Science, with excitement, intuiting that, from the perspective of the computer at the end of everything, which he would be a part of and which would synthetically resemble an undifferentiated oneness, it didn’t matter if he had never kissed a girl, was too anxious to communicate with his peers, had no friends, etc. When Erin woke, seeming depressed and confused, avoiding looking at anything as she sat up, Paul patted his lap and she lay there again. Paul asked if she could think of a newer word for “computer” than “computer,” which seemed outdated and, in still being used, suspicious in some way, like maybe the word itself was intelligent and had manipulated culture in its favor, perpetuating its usage.“I’m still thinking,” she said after a few minutes.“I don’t think my question made sense,” said Paul. “There can’t be a newer word . . . for the same word.”• • •More framed pictures of Paul were on display in his room, it seemed, than last year. Seeing them (two as a baby, four as a small child, one as an adolescent, two as a teenager in his marching band uniform) arranged on shelves, in two corners, Paul imagined his mother placing them strategically to affect him to use less drugs. He gathered all but one (in which he was nine or ten and grinning and holding, for some reason, a Three Musketeers–style sword, with his parents and brother, in a professional studio in Taipei, with an outer-space-themed background, unfurled like a scroll, he vaguely remembered, on the wall, pre–green screen) and stacked them—so many the room had felt like a memorial—facedown on a dresser, saying they made him uncomfortable. Erin asked why and said he looked cute and happy in them. Paul said he would feel uncomfortable seeing that many of anyone’s face.The next afternoon, walking to a street market, Paul and Erin stopped to look at a two-story McDonald’s with five employees outside speaking into megaphones, sometimes in unison, waving banners and flags. Paul said there were fewer McDonald’s in Taiwan than fifteen years ago, that this was probably a “last-ditch effort,” which seemed to be working (the first floor—they could see through the glass front—was entirely filled with customers). Erin said they should improvise a documentary titled Taiwan’s Last McDonald’s or Taiwan’s First McDonald’s. They walked to the end of the street market and back, on the same route, buying and eating things, then bought and ate egg tarts from two different bakeries, then with nervous grins earnestly discussed eating however many egg tarts it would take for them to not want more, but resisted and returned to the apartment building, where they lay for an hour in the building’s sauna and dog-paddled, in a heated pool, to six different massage stations, including one—partly simulating a waterfall, maybe—where water fell eight to ten feet in pummeling, faucet-like columns onto the tops of their heads.• • •“My face won’t stop being red from the thing,” said Erin, an hour later, in Paul’s room, in a voice like she was mostly thinking about something else. Paul was trying to open the taped CD case for Nirvana’s second “greatest hits” collection. He looked at Erin briefly. “It looks good,” he mumbled looking at the CD case. His mother, in the hallway outside the room, whose door was open a few inches, said something in Mandarin.“What?” said Paul in Mandarin.“Bring your phone,” said Paul’s mother in Mandarin.“Okay.”“What?”“Okay,” said Paul in Mandarin. “Don’t worry,” he said in Mandarin in a louder, agitated-sounding voice.“Okay. Your father and I are going to eat.”“Okay,” said Paul in Mandarin.“Do you . . . want to come eat together?”“No,” said Paul in Mandarin.“They’re leaving,” said Paul after a few seconds.“Oh,” said Erin in a staccato with a worried expression.“We’ll wait till they leave.”“Oh,” said Erin.“Before we—” said Paul.Erin nodded attentively.“They’re going to eat,” said Paul, and walked to a bookshelf and stared at two hardbound Animal Life volumes with the same image of a cheetah climbing a tree on their spines. He opened and closed a drawer, aware he wasn’t thinking anything, then put on black socks and hugged Erin from behind. They looked at themselves, being recorded, on the screen—uniquely neither reflection nor movie, but viewable perspective—of Paul’s MacBook, smiling sarcastically. Their plan for tonight was to ingest MDMA, after Paul’s parents left, and go to a shopping district where the streets, closed off to cars, were used as giant sidewalks. Paul showed Erin its Wikipedia page (“Ximending is the source of Taiwan’s fashion, subculture, and Japanese culture) and typed “ximending” in Google Images.“Whoa,” said Erin. “Looks like Times Square.”“We’re leaving,” shouted Paul’s mother a few minutes later, when Paul and Erin were looking at the Wikipedia page for 28 Days Later, which Erin had said was one of her favorite movies. Paul was rereading a sentence (“As he gets hit by a car in his flashback, he simultaneously dies on the operating table”) for the fourth time, in idle confusion, when the apartment’s metal door closed in a loud and distinct but, Paul thought, non-ominous click.Ten minutes later Paul was at the dining table staring at an email from Calvin (“hi bro. did you get the steaks my dad sent you? lol . . .”) while waiting for Erin, who was in the bathroom. Paul typed “hi” and his eyes unfocused. He typed “,” and saved “hi,” as a draft. He minimized Safari and saw his face, which seemed bored and depressed, his default expression. He maximized Safari and imagined millions of windows, positioned to appear like one window. He closed his eyes and thought of the backs of his eyelids as computer screens; both could display anything imaginable, so had infinite depth, but as physical surfaces were nearly depthless. Paul typed “ppl are powerful computers w 2 computer screens & free/fast/reliable access to their own internet” in Twitter, copied it, closed Twitter, pasted it in his Gmail draft of tweet drafts. He was thinking about the fast-food restaurant Arby’s, which he’d always felt a little confused by, when Erin appeared behind him and patted his shoulders with both hands moving up and down.“Let’s hug as hard as we can,” said Paul, and stood and they did. “I think being squished really hard is what people who cut themselves get . . . to feel.”“Have you cut yourself?”“No. Have you?”“No,” said Erin carrying the MacBook toward the front door.“Why would being squished feel good?” said Paul absently.“Hm,” said Erin. “Do you have m—”“Raarrr!” screamed Paul with his mouth open.“Jesus,” said Erin grinning.“Does it smell?” said Paul about his breath.“Maybe like coffee a little bit. But it’s okay.”Paul jogged to the bathroom, brushed his teeth and tongue, rinsed his mouth, jogged to the front door. Erin asked if he had her “ID thing”—he did—then touched his arm and quickly said “do you feel okay?” in a high-pitched voice. Paul, who’d begun to feel the MDMA, looked at Erin’s hand and imagined feeling utter disbelief, increasing to uncontrollable rage, that she would touch his arm, at a time like this. “Yeah,” he said with a neutral expression. “Do you?”“Yeah,” said Erin. “Wait, is my—”“Smells vaguely of barbecue, but it’s good,” said Paul, and patted her shoulder.“Vaguely of barbecue,” said Erin grinning.In the mirror-walled elevator they stared at themselves on the screen of Paul’s MacBook, which Erin held waist level. Paul moved in a parody of a robot and lightly slapped Erin twice. Erin slapped Paul once and, after exiting the elevator, yawned audibly, as they approached an atrium of spiral staircases and a gigantic Christmas tree.“Look,” said Paul with a fish-like expression.Erin laughed loudly. “Jesus,” she said.“You made a Jack Nicholson facial expression.”“Really?” said Erin, and laughed.“Your eyebrows went,” said Paul demonstrating.“Whoa,” said Erin loudly. “I made a soundboard laugh.”“Oh,” said Paul. “Oh,” he said quietly, and moved toward a potted plant and, before reaching it, jumped in place, slightly confused by his own behavior. Erin said she thought Paul was going to “jump on.” There was a suctioned, whooshing noise as they exited automatically opening doors onto a wide sidewalk. Paul turned left—into Erin, who almost dropped the MacBook—and sustained an uninhibited, yelping noise for three or four seconds, imagining himself as a butler in a Disney movie in comically prolonged recovery from almost dropping an elaborately layered tray of desserts and drinks. Paul had an urge to practice the noise repeatedly, with increasing frustration, trying to perfect it—cut-scene to him in a straitjacket.“Jesus,” said Erin grinning. “Should I get dramatic shots of the street?”“Whatever you want.”“Dramatic ass shots,” said Erin.“It’s your night,” said Paul in vague reference to the Cinderella archetype of a beautiful, oppressed, sympathetic character that experiences a hectic reversal of fortune. “I keep thinking ‘this is our night’ for some reason,” he said a few minutes later, and his eyes felt shiny, and he thought of shyness, acceptance. “I wonder what it’s going to be like for us, for our twenty days here,” he said as they crossed a street. “What are we going to . . . do?”“What if we get divorced by then?”“It seems possible,” said Paul. “Twenty-eight days.”“Twenty-eight days,” said Erin grinning. “Twenty-day immersion technique.”“Have you ever spent twenty straight days—”“Yeah,” said Erin.“You have?”“With Jennika. This summer, in Seattle.”“I mean with a boyfriend,” said Paul, and imagined himself becoming physically faceted by rapidly facing different directions, in 15-degree movements, advancing blurrily ahead as a barely visible, wave-like curvature.“Oh. Yeah. Probably.”“Who?”“First boyfriend. Kent.”“Sleeping together?” said Paul suppressing an urge to scream it in mock disbelief. Erin said they were together “like every day” in the beginning and that “it seemed okay.” Paul asked what she meant by “okay” and visualized “it seemed” darkening and “okay” brightening colorfully. He mock studied “okay,” which suddenly enlarged and disappeared by “flying” through him, it seemed. Paul felt vaguely, uncertainly amused. Erin was explaining that she and Kent didn’t fight until she used his computer to write a paper and saw a folder of naked girlfriend pictures, which Kent said were from so long ago he couldn’t remember and that the girl lived in Poland and he didn’t talk to her anymore, all of which were lies.“How do you feel about our fights so far?”“I feel . . . they seem to be okay,” said Erin descending stairs into a powerfully air-conditioned MRT station, marbled and quiet and clean, with the austere plainness of an established museum. “I still feel the same amount of interest toward you. But I think I worry more. I worry like ‘he might actually have a reaction toward this so I’ll think about it more.’ Or something. How do you think about them?”“They seem fine,” said Paul.“Is . . . this how it usually goes?”“Yeah,” said Paul with the word extended.“Like the fights are similar?”“Um, yeah . . . I don’t have the kind of fight where it’s, like, ‘fighting,’ ” said Paul as they passed a bakery where he photographed and ate a crispy, red-bean-paste-filled croissant last year. “Like, yelling at each other and trying to ‘win,’ or something. Or, like, forgetting about it.”“Or like what?”“Like ‘winning.’ I don’t have that kind of fight.”“Oh,” said Erin.“Ever,” said Paul quietly.Erin said with Kent she had the kind of fight where it turned into “proving a point,” then escalated into yelling. Paul asked if she fought with Harris, her second boyfriend.“No,” said Erin.“You have a curling effect,” said Paul touching her hair. “I like it. Is that what you’re going for?”“Yeah,” said Erin smiling endearingly.“You didn’t fight with the second one at all?”“We had fights like you and I, like discussion-style things,” said Erin. “I don’t think we ever yelled at each other. Except, did we ever, no—no, we never yelled.”“How do you feel about me compared to your other boyfriends?”“I like you more,” said Erin.“Than all of them?”“Yeah,” said Erin.“I like you—”“You—” said Erin.“—more also,” said Paul.“Really?”“Yeah,” said Paul.“Sweet,” said Erin. “You seem to encompass major things of what I want, in ways I feel like only segments of other people . . . have.” She patted Paul’s chest and said “I like you” as they approached an intersection of corridors, wide as four-lane streets, where last year, leaning against a pillar in the left corridor, Paul read the last few pages of Kōbō Abe’s The Face of Another, which ended with the narrator, hiding behind a pillar, about to attack his “imposter.” Paul realized they were walking the wrong direction, and they turned around.“What do you think your parents think about me?”“They . . . like you,” said Paul, and laughed quietly.“Do they usually act like . . . the way they did?”“Yeah,” said Paul uncertainly. “I think they’re always focused on me, not the other person. But, yeah.”“I wondered about that.”“My mom’s probably thinking about drugs a lot,” said Paul, and Erin laughed and hiccupped, it seemed, at the same time. Paul said “I mean worried about drugs.”“Is she addicted? Do you think?”“Yeah,” said Paul grinning.Erin said she’d noticed that Paul sometimes sounded “really angry” when talking to his mother in Mandarin. Paul said he didn’t feel angry, that he had gotten into a habit, from being a spoiled child, of talking to her like that and that it used to be “way worse.” Until he was 7 or 8 his voice, incomprehensible to anyone outside his family, had been a harmonica-like, almost electronic, squealing-bleating noise, which wholly outsourced the task of articulation, in the form of deciphering, to the listener. Paul’s brother would tell him to “stop screaming” or “stop whining.” Paul’s mother, the listener probably 95 percent of the time, a shy and anxious person herself, probably had strongly encouraged and liked how unrestrained and unself-conscious Paul had been.“I was surprised,” said Erin. “I’ve never heard you talk like that.”“I really don’t like it,” said Paul.“It’s interesting,” said Erin stepping onto a down escalator.“I’m embarrassed about it.”“I do it with my parents,” said Erin smiling.“What have you read by Kōbō Abe?”“Just The Woman in the Dunes.”“What else do you think about me?” said Paul, and laughed sarcastically, which Erin also did, then both abruptly stopped and hugged and, stepping off the escalator, approached one of eight automated turnstiles. Paul said “just hold it to the thing” about Erin’s MRT card, then in a deeper voice than normal “wait, wait” and, after a pause, that he was “going to poop.”Paul could see himself, after exiting the bathroom, shakily enlarging on the screen of his MacBook, which Erin pointed at him, as he maneuvered toward it in a flighty zigzag, perpendicularly against people walking to and from turnstiles, escalators. “I just vomited, like, water,” he said.“Oh my god. Really? Are you sick?”“No, I’m just getting the feeling of a lot of emptiness.”“Oh. I was going to go poop but the—”“Go, go,” said Paul.“—like the thing, or, okay,” said Erin.“Wikipedia? What?”“The thing in the floor? I wasn’t sure how to use it.”“You went in there?” said Paul.“It’s just, like, a hole in the floor, interesting.”“What if I couldn’t find you?”“Huh?” said Erin with a confused expression.“What if I couldn’t find you? You went in the bathroom?”“I just went in for a second, with the intention of—”“Go, go,” said Paul patting Erin’s shoulder, and she went. Paul set his MacBook on the floor. His legs moved in and out of view for a few minutes. “Hello?” he said in Mandarin into his iPhone. “Okay, okay, we’re leaving now, okay, bye.” Erin was skipping toward him and, it seemed, flapping her arms. Paul said his mother called to remind them they can’t eat or drink on the train. Erin smiled and said “oh, helpful” sincerely and they passed turnstiles, descended two floors, waited two minutes, sat in a train. Paul asked what Erin hadn’t liked about her other boyfriends.“Like, things that have just bothered me?”“Let’s just talk about . . . Harris,” said Paul.“Okay. Um, bothered me that he, like, had a lot of friends and a big social life. And didn’t seem to be okay with how I just had him and one other friend. He’d be like ‘you need to focus on me less and get more friends.’ I felt bothered that that was constant. And I didn’t like it that sometimes he seemed to make insensitive comments. There was one incident where I had to get a . . . surgery-type thing on my, like, cervix . . . thing.”“What was it?”“To remove precancerous cells, or something.”“Whoa,” said Paul.“They had to, like, burn—”“Is that normal?”“Yeah, relatively, but I couldn’t do anything for three weeks, then finally when we did . . . this weird-looking thing came out? And, I don’t know, I felt really self-conscious, and the first thing he was just like ‘ew’ and, like, backed away from me and I was like ‘I can’t help it.’ I don’t know. It bothered me at the time but now . . . I don’t know.”“Are you on birth control right now?”“No. I haven’t had my period but I’ve also taken three pregnancy tests, I’m not pregnant.”“When did you take three pregnancy tests?”“Periodically. One time I didn’t have my period for a year and a half. I feel like I should get on birth control. Because I have my period when I’m on it.”“Isn’t it healthier to not be on it?”“Yeah. That’s why I’m not on it.”“It seems fine,” said Paul vaguely.“Really?”“Yeah,” said Paul trying to remember something he wanted to say on the topic of friends. “It . . . doesn’t matter to me if I come in you or somewhere else.”“Okay,” said Erin.“Um,” said Paul distractedly.“This is probably the most that a guy has come in me without being on it. But I figure if anything happens we’re probably similarly . . . minded.” Erin looked at Paul with an ironic expression and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Because you want to have kids,” she said in a mock-serious voice. “Soon. Right?”Paul nodded, aware he probably appeared confused.“That was our goal in getting married,” said Erin.Paul patted her thigh twice and grinned a little.“We’re not in sin anymore,” said Erin completing the joke, mostly to herself, it seemed.“I’ve always, um, felt like . . .” said Paul quietly.“Huh?” said Erin staring at his blank expression.“Weird about friends,” murmured Paul. “I never hang out with other people if I’m in a relationship.”Erin nodded rapidly, seeming a little anxious.“We’re here,” said Paul, and they exited the train as it said XIMEN STATION (and something about Chiang Kai-shek) in Mandarin, Cantonese, Taiwanese, English in a female, robot voice. Paul sneezed and looked at his hands rubbing the front of his shirt, aware of Erin also looking, both with neutral expressions. “Um,” said Paul on an up escalator to another train platform. “How did you deal with Harris having that many friends?”“I would hang out with them. Harris and I were similar in the way we would joke about things, and I liked that his friends seemed to like me . . . or, like, they laughed at me, and him, when we were together. But it was weird because it was obvious that I never became friends with any of them. What problems . . . do you have?”“With friends?”“Girlfriends. The same question you asked me.”“With . . . who?”“Uh, with Michelle,” said Erin.“Just . . . her friends,” said Paul on an up escalator to the station’s main floor. “She would want to hang out with friends. And I wouldn’t want to . . .”“Is there anything about her? Like, as a person.”“I feel like we weren’t perfectly—we weren’t, um, optimally excited by each other.”“How? How?”“Just, like, she didn’t like the same things that I liked . . . as much.”“Oh,” said Erin. “Like On the Road things?”“Yeah,” Paul said, who hadn’t liked On the Road as much as Michelle, who had rated one of his favorite books, Chilly Scenes of Winter, which she’d said she “liked,” two out of five stars on Goodreads, after their relationship had ended. “And then, uh, I felt like maybe she . . . had a slightly neurotic aversion toward blow jobs, I feel,” said Paul.“Seriously? I wouldn’t expect that.”“She would do it, but not as much as I would to her, I think,” said Paul as they reached street level, at an intersection, where two corner buildings seemed armored with layers of billboards and lighted signs and, near the top of one, like a face, a giant screen, showing a movie preview. On a plaza was a donation bucket decorated like a Christmas tree and a grand piano without a player. “Sometimes she would joke about how it was ‘degrading,’ but I feel like she wasn’t completely joking.”They entered the area blocked off to cars.“So maybe I wasn’t satisfied with that,” said Paul.“What other things sexually?”“Sexually?”“About her, or about anybody.”“Uh, I don’t have that many sexual complaints. What about you?”“With Kent it got really boring and routine.”“How?”“It was just the same thing. He would go down on me, then we would have missionary style, and that’s it . . . that’s, like, it. Harris, similarly, we never really gave each other oral sex, toward the middle and end. But I really like that, both ways. And it also became sort of the same thing with him, where we would do missionary. Then I would . . .”“Then you would . . .”“ . . . like, finger myself,” said Erin at a lower pitch with a complicated expression that Paul saw peripherally.“You would finger yourself? While he was doing it?”“Yeah,” said Erin.“Did you like that?”“It was okay. Seemed business-oriented. So we could both . . .”Paul made a noise indicating he understood.“How do you feel about . . .”“What?” said Paul, dimly aware and liking that they’d  remained focused on their conversation instead of acknowledging their new, intense environment, which was bright and chaotic and crowded but, without vehicles, relatively quiet, more calming than stressful. Paul felt like he and Erin—and their conversation—were in the backseat of a soundproofed, window-tinted limousine.“How we have sex?”“Seems fine,” said Paul.“Do you have any critiques? Any.”“Critiques,” said Paul. “Um, no.”“Really? You can say.”“Critiques,” said Paul.“Or anything. Any thoughts.”“Um, no. I don’t think it’s that big of a thing for me: sex.”“Yeah,” said Erin vaguely.“What do you have about that—with me?”“I have none for you,” said Erin.“Are you sure? You can say it.”“No, you’re good at everything—”“Really?”“—and you keep it interesting,” said Erin.“Really?”“And I have orgasms . . . regularly.”Paul made a quiet noise of acknowledgment.“Everything’s good,” said Erin.Paul repeated the noise.“But I also don’t feel like it’s a big thing. Do you feel thirsty?”“We’ll get something,” said Paul nodding distractedly. “What else?”“Hm. For sex?”“Anything,” said Paul.“Anything,” said Erin in a child-like voice.“Um,” said Paul, and from somewhere behind them someone began playing piano. Paul instantly felt a sheen of wetness to his now “horizontally seeking,” it seemed, eyeballs. In the movie of his life, he knew, now would be the moment—like when a character quotes Coleridge in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as the screen shows blurry, colorful, festive images of people outside at night—to feel that the world was “beautiful and sad,” which he felt self-consciously and briefly, exerting effort to focus instead on the conversation, which was producing its own, unmediated emotions. “Um,” he said shifting his MacBook.“I can hold,” said Erin taking the MacBook.“What else for you?”“Nothing,” said Erin.“What other questions do you have?”“I was mainly wondering about the sexual stuff. I like asking questions like this, though.”“Ask me,” said Paul mock pleading.“Do you usually ask questions like this?”“Um, no. I think it’s—some of it’s—because we’re on drugs.”“Oh yeah,” said Erin.“But we also ask questions at other times.”“Yeah,” said Erin. “What do you feel about the drugs thing? In terms of your life, long term.”“Um. I think it’s sustainable, as long as I’m healthy. Or I think if I’m really healthy I’ll be better off than someone who isn’t healthy and doesn’t do drugs. And doing drugs encourages me to be healthy, which increases productivity, which seems good. What do you think?”“I feel like this is the most drugs I’ve ever done in a period in life,” said Erin. “But it’s also the healthiest I’ve been, in life. I think similarly about it.”“In some relationships I would use food to console myself.”“Me too,” said Erin. “Big-time.”“There’s not that, with us, so that’s good.”“Yeah,” said Erin. “I’ve done that a lot.”“Me too. Eating a ton of shitty food. Being excited with the other person about food . . . seems depressing. We also don’t drink alcohol, which seems good.”“Yeah,” said Erin. “I did the food thing with Harris. And Beau. When you and I had started hanging out, but not romantically or something, I was eating sushi and Beau got something fried and was like ‘don’t you just want to eat unhealthy things together and bond over that?’ ”“None of your boyfriends cared about you eating a lot?”“Kent wanted me to, like, gain some weight. Harris . . . quietly resented my body, I think, or something. He was really skinny. And I gained like five or ten pounds in the course of dating him. And—”“What did he resent?”“Just that—”“Was he skinnier than me?”“Maybe . . . yeah. Or, like, less muscular. He was maybe a little bit taller but really small.”“What did he resent?”“I think ‘resent’ isn’t the right word. I think . . . no, he did resent it because I weighed more than him and I think he didn’t like that he had to put up with it, instead of being with a naturally smaller body.”“Then wouldn’t he care if you ate a lot?”“Yeah, but we never stopped eating a lot.”“Oh,” said Paul.“Or maybe he would care, but not that much. I don’t know. What is my body . . . do you have problems with my body?”“No . . . what problems?”“Or, do you like it?”“Yeah,” said Paul at a higher pitch than normal.“If you don’t you can . . . something,” said Erin lightly.“No, yeah, I do,” said Paul. “What would your ideal body be?”“For me?”“For a boyfriend,” said Paul.“I don’t think I’ve thought that. Just, like, skinny and healthy looking. Like, I’ve never minded if . . . hm.”“Not ‘minded.’ ‘Ideal.’ ”“Oh. Then yeah.”“What,” said Paul.“I guess weigh a little more than me. Enough to not be self-conscious about it. Or just not care. I don’t know. What about—”“I think my ideal is, like, the same, I think, or—”“Really?” said Erin.“Yeah,” said Paul, who was an inch taller than Erin and weighed a little less.“Oh,” said Erin anxiously.“Or, like—” said Paul.“The same,” said Erin.“But I think overall it doesn’t matter that much.”“Yeah,” said Erin.“Because Michelle . . .”“She seemed really skinny,” said Erin.“I think what matters to me most, in terms of that, is just that things aren’t getting worse.”“Yeah,” said Erin. “Me too.”“I think I can get fixated on that neurotically.”“I do with myself definitely,” said Erin. “You mean for yourself?”“No,” said Paul. “Other people.”“How do you mean?”“I can become fixated on it.”“On, like, in what way?”“On what the other person weighs.”“Oh,” said Erin.“I feel like it’s neurotic to some degree,” said Paul.“I don’t care that much,” said Erin ambiguously.“If they weighed the ideal I would find some other neurotic thing to focus on.”“You would find something else to focus on?”“Yeah,” said Paul.“Like body-wise, or something else–wise?”“Something else–wise.”“Oh,” said Erin.“It’s not a solution, or something, to find someone with the ideal . . . but focusing on not getting worse seems fine to me.”“Yeah,” said Erin.“Yeah,” said Paul slowly.“Yeah,” said Erin. “That seems like . . .”“You have to focus on something, and—”“7-Eleven,” said Erin pointing.“Huh?” said Paul, distracted from the conversation for the first time since he heard the piano, and couldn’t remember what he’d wanted to say. He followed Erin into 7-Eleven, feeling imponderable to himself, like his brain was of him, external as a color, shooting away from its source.“I feel irritated by all the stuff going on,” said Erin on a wide sidewalk parallel to a four-lane street, outside the area of closed-off streets, around twenty minutes later. “Or like I can’t concentrate on talking.” Paul had become quiet after 7-Eleven and had talked slowly and incoherently, he felt, on topics that didn’t interest him, with increasing calmness, and now felt peacefully catatonic, like a person in a photograph, except for a pressure to speak and a vague awareness that he couldn’t remember what Erin had last said.“Do you feel anything from the MDMA?”“Yeah,” said Paul in a bored voice.“How do you feel?”“About what?” said Paul.“Do you feel happy? Or do you feel what?”“Right now?” said Paul, as if stalling.“Yeah,” said Erin.“Yeah, happy,” said Paul looking down a little, aware his face hadn’t moved in a long time. “Physically uncomfortable a little. I want to poop.”“You what? What was the last thing?”“I want to poop,” mumbled Paul.“I feel like I want to hit people, a little,” said Erin grinning.“Let’s go in one of those places,” said Paul slowly, with a sensation of not being prepared to speak and not yet knowing what he was saying. He listened to what he’d said and pointed at a building that said PARTY WORLD and, seeing his arm, in his vision, sensed he hadn’t carried his MacBook in a long time and should offer to carry it soon.“Yeah,” said Erin distractedly.They walked silently for around forty seconds.“What are you thinking about?”“I don’t know,” said Paul honestly. “What are you?”“I thought ‘I wonder what we’re going to do.’ Then I thought ‘we aren’t talking anymore—oh no, why aren’t we talking anymore.’ You’re not upset about anything?”Paul shook his head repeatedly.“Okay, okay,” said Erin.“No,” thought Paul emotionlessly.“People seem to be looking a lot, at the computer.”“I haven’t . . . noticed anyone,” said Paul.“Oh,” said Erin uncertainly. “I haven’t—”“I haven’t been looking at anyone.”“I haven’t either, really, except sometimes if I look out somebody will be looking. I forgot we’re not in America.”“I like how quiet it is,” said Paul.“Me too,” said Erin.“In New York it would be so loud.”“Yeah. There would be, like, layers upon layers of noises.”“I don’t like places . . . where everyone working is a minority . . . because I feel like there’s too many different . . . I don’t know,” said Paul with a feeling like he unequivocally did not want to be talking about what he was talking about, but had accidentally focused on it, like a telescope a child had turned, away from a constellation, toward a wall.“Like, visually?”“Um, no,” said Paul. “Just that . . . they know they’re minorities . . .”“That they, like, band together?”“Um, no,” said Paul on a down escalator into the MRT station they exited around an hour ago.“What are we doing?” said Erin in a quiet, confused voice. Paul felt his diagonal movement as a humorless, surreal activity—a deepening, forward and down.“Minorities,” said Erin at a normal volume. “What were you saying?”“Just that . . . here, when you see someone, you don’t know . . . that . . . they live like two hours away and are um . . . poor, or whatever,” said Paul very slowly, like he was improvising an erasure poem from a mental image of a page of text.“Is this the mall? Thing?”“No, bathroom,” mumbled Paul.“Huh?” said Erin.“Bathroom,” said Paul after a few seconds.• • •In the MRT station Paul said he tried masturbating and couldn’t and that he was worried he vomited some of his MDMA earlier, because he didn’t feel much. Erin said she felt like she was “feeling it a lot more” than Paul and laughed a little and said Paul should “go back and take more.”“Really?” said Paul quietly.“Yeah. Because I feel like if you were also feeling it . . .”“What,” said Paul.“Now I feel myself being chill, or something. Or I don’t know. I didn’t know what was going on. I thought it seemed like you weren’t feeling anything.”“Really?” said Paul with earnest wonderment.“Yeah. Let’s just go back and do more, then come back.”“All right,” said Paul in a voice as if reluctantly acquiescing.“Do you want that?”“Yeah. I’ll take two, you take one.”“Okay,” said Erin.“But . . . now I’m going to have it stronger than you.”“I’ll take one and a half,” said Erin.After both ingesting two ecstasy and, almost idly, as sort of afterthoughts, because it had been very weak the past few times, a little LSD, they exited Paul’s room, and Erin went to the bathroom. Paul’s mother asked Paul what clothes he bought. Paul said he didn’t yet and his mother said he should buy thicker clothing and they discussed where, at this time, around 10:30 p.m., to find open stores. When Erin exited the bathroom Paul’s mother asked if she bought any clothes.“No,” said Erin smiling. “Not yet.”“Okay,” said Paul in Mandarin. “We’re going now.”“Cell phone,” said Paul’s mother in Mandarin.“I’ve got it,” said Paul in Mandarin.“Bring a cell phone,” said Paul’s father in Mandarin from out of view, watching TV.“Why are you bringing your computer?” said Paul’s mother in Mandarin.“We, just,” said Paul in Mandarin.“Oh, you’re going to record again,” said Paul’s mother in Mandarin in a slightly scolding voice, but without worry, it seemed, maybe because she could see that Paul was the same as last year. “The ‘video thing,’ isn’t it better?”“What video thing?”“I sent it to you. I bought it for you. For your birthday. Did you already sell it?”“No. I have it in my room.”“What’s it called?”“Flip cam,” said Paul.“Dad went to many different places asking which was the best. Why don’t you use it?”“What are you all talking about?” said Paul’s father idly in Mandarin from out of view.“My mom probably knows we’re on drugs, or something,” said Paul after they’d walked around two minutes without talking. “She sounded suspicious when she saw us recording. But she seemed okay with it. I searched my emails with her earlier and . . . she said something like ‘it’s okay to experience new things but don’t overdo it,’ or like ‘it’s probably good for a writer to experiment,’ and she was talking about cocaine, I think.”“I thought your mom was completely against drugs.”“Me too,” said Paul. “I forgot an entire period of emails where she seemed okay with it. My brother, I think, told her, at one point, that I had too much self-control to become addicted to anything. My brother told her not to worry, I think. I don’t know.”“I haven’t swallowed the LSD yet,” said Erin at a red light a few minutes later. “My throat won’t push it down to my stomach, it’s weird.” Paul distractedly pointed at a billboard of disabled people, then looked at Erin’s tattoo of an asterisk behind her earlobe as she looked at the billboard. “In Taiwan only disabled people, I think, can sell lottery tickets,” said Paul slowly while imagining being heard by thousands of readers of a future book, or book-like experience, in which Erin’s name had an asterisk by it, indicating the option of stopping the narrative to learn about Erin, in the form of a living footnote, currently pointing the MacBook at the three-lane street, on which hundreds of scooters and motorcycles passing, in layers, with more than one per lane, at different speeds, appeared like a stationary, patternless shuffling.“Swarming,” Erin was saying. “Swarm. Swarm.”“My mom warned against getting hit by a car,” said Paul.“Does it happen a lot?”“I don’t know,” said Paul as a car honked. “I don’t know.”“I kind of have to pee again,” said Erin crossing the street.“You have to pee? We’ll find somewhere.”“In my public-speaking class, on the last day, this guy spoke about how he has kidney failure and can’t pee. At all. He poops his pee.”“He doesn’t even have a tube?”“No,” said Erin.“How old is he?”“Twenty-four,” said Erin.“Whoa,” said Paul.“Yeah. And he has a big thing in his arm—his dialysis machine.”“From drinking alcohol?”“He didn’t say why,” said Erin, and a man wearing a motorcycle helmet in the near distance walked briskly across the sidewalk, seeming “too comfortable in his motorcycle helmet,” thought Paul with mock disapproval, into a 7-Eleven.“What if we just moved here,” said Paul.“Let’s move here,” said Erin with enthusiasm.“Since we don’t have friends. What would we do all the time?”“Work on writing,” said Erin. “We’d have to go back, to do promotion things.”“We can pay people to pretend to be us.”“Interns,” said Erin.“Backpacks,” said Paul a few minutes later about a vat-like container of generic-looking backpacks, outside a foot-wear store. “What do you think of these?”“They seem good. Simple.”“Your red backpack . . . is really dirty,” said Paul, and laughed nervously.“It only looks dirty. I clean it a lot.”“Backpack,” said Paul touching a black backpack.“I would buy one but my mom said she’s buying me one for Christmas,” said Erin.After peeing in an MRT station they decided to find a McDonald’s and improvise Taiwan’s First McDonald’s. Paul’s MacBook had seventy-two minutes of battery power remaining. They couldn’t find a McDonald’s, after around five minutes, but two Burger Kings were in view, so they decided to do Taiwan’s First Burger King, then crossed a street and saw a McDonald’s, six to ten blocks away. “Let’s not talk until we get there,” said Paul. “But start thinking.”“Let’s not think of what to say, let’s just do it,” said Erin.“Just as an experiment, let’s not talk until we get there.”“Oh,” said Erin. “Okay, okay.”Paul stared at her with an exaggeratedly disgusted expression, which she reciprocated. They ran diagonally across three lanes to a median and held their open palms out to motorcyclists advancing in the spaces between slow-moving and stopped cars, as if by vacuum suction. Two people on one motorcycle shouted “hey, hey, go, yeah!” and slapped Erin’s palm. Paul and Erin, both smiling widely, crossed to a sidewalk and turned toward McDonald’s. Paul took the MacBook and stared in earnest fascination—feeling almost appalled, but without aversion—as Erin ran and leaped stomach-first onto the front of a parked car, then speed-walked away with arms tight against her sides, crossing Paul’s vision, supernatural and comical as a mysterious creature on YouTube, before calmly taking the MacBook. Paul stared angrily at the sidewalk with his body bent forward, imagining a powerful magnet dragging him by a strip of metal at the top of his forehead. He began hitting his head with balled fists. Erin hit his head, and he instantly stared at her in mock disbelief. Erin grasped the floor of an invisible opening midair with both arms extended, not fully, above her. Paul, staring with earnest astonishment, imagined a ventilation-system-like tunnel and pulled her arms down while trying to feign an expression of “feigned disgust unsuccessfully concealing immense excitement,” as if Erin had unknowingly discovered the entrance to a place Paul had recently stopped trying (after a decade of research, massive debt, the inadvertent nurturing of an antisocial personality) to locate. He laughed and continued ahead and—two blocks later, nearing McDonald’s, which had a suburban-seeming front yard of quadrilaterals of grass, a sidewalk, gigantic Christmas tree, lighted menu, driveway for the drive-thru—he accelerated and entered McDonald’s saying “let’s get a shot with a lot of background activity to lure them back with the rewatches,” and after a few seconds, because the first floor had only an ordering counter, was  ascending stairs, to the second floor, where eight to twelve people were in forty to sixty seats.“Try to find a celebrity face to stand in front of,” said Erin.“I’m going to wash my face, I can’t appear like this,” said Paul grinning, and went to the bathroom. When he returned Erin was picking at her hair, with elbows locked above her head, hands moving inward in a kind of puppetry, or to cast spells on her head. She left for the bathroom. Christmas music played on a loop, repeating every forty or fifty seconds. Paul looked at what seemed to be a group of mute people in a separate, attached, somewhat private room and thought of a documentary about a woman who became deaf and mute as a teenager and remained on her bed feeling depressed, she said, for fifteen years before devoting her life to traveling across Germany teaching the deaf-mute language and “bringing out” those, born deaf-mute, with whom communication had never been attempted. Paul was absently drumming the table with his hands when Erin returned. He stood and said they should start the documentary outside, pointed at the attached room, said “look, those people are mute, I think.”Erin seemed confused and slightly frightened.“Mute,” said Paul. “It’s a group of mute people.”“Oh, mute. Jesus, I thought I was having a drug thing.”“Jesus,” said Paul.“They’re like how we were,” said Erin.“Oh yeah,” said Paul.“When we couldn’t talk, I felt like I had to talk,” said Erin descending stairs. “But I had nothing to say. I just felt encompassed by the limits.”They sat on a grassy area of the median—after deciding to begin Taiwan’s First McDonald’s “in the middle of traffic”—and criticized their own, while complimenting each other’s,  hair and faces for three minutes until Paul abruptly stood and said “let’s go inside” with a sensation of “surveying” the premises, though his eyes were unfocused.“I started feeling things big-time,” said Erin.“Me too,” said Paul.“Big-time style,” said Erin, and they ran across the street into McDonald’s, to the second floor. “We’re back . . . here . . . again,” said Paul, and laughed a little while feeling the situation was hilarious.“Yeah,” said Erin laughing, and they returned outside.“You be the host,” said Paul pointing the MacBook at Erin, who stood in front of the lighted menu the size of a blackboard.“For Bravo,” said Erin.“Use ‘the voice.’ Just don’t grin.”“Okay, okay,” said Erin.“Just don’t grin,” said Paul.“Well, here’s the flagship, uh, Taipei’s fir—”“Let me try,” said Paul giving Erin the MacBook.Erin made noises indicating failure, self-disgust.“So this is the first McDonald’s to open, in, um, well, Taiwan,” said Paul. “It opened on . . . Tuesday. They had the grand opening special of three patties.” He moved his ear to an image of a Double Filet-O-Fish on the menu and said “it doesn’t want to be filmed” to Erin, who said “the camera is not on” with exaggerated enunciation to the Double Filet-O-Fish. “Here is . . . this is Hillary Clinton’s hairstyle,” said Paul pointing at lettuce protruding from a chicken sandwich.“Tactical, um,” said Erin.“Explosions,” said Paul after a few seconds.“Well, yeah,” said Erin.“Jesus,” said Paul, and they both grinned a little. “All right. Now we’ll go inside for a closer look . . . at the conflict, the controversy.” Through the glass front a deliveryman, wearing a motorcycle helmet, peeked around a corner at the ordering counter. “It’s been said that he’s actually the founder of McDonald’s,” said Paul. “They stole his idea, now he just looks. I actually just heard someone talking about it over there. That guy!”Erin pointed the MacBook at a man scurrying away from McDonald’s.“He won’t go ‘on the record,’ ” said Paul. “He’s too afraid.”“Let’s move inside,” said Erin, and pointed at a PUSH sticker. “Oh, this is actually—”“They had to add that. Because people actually were trying to, um—”“Pull,” said Erin.“Yeah, pull,” said Paul grinning, and didn’t move for two seconds, unsure if there was more to say about the PUSH sticker, then took the MacBook and entered McDonald’s. “Now, this,” he said about a tall structure obscured by colorful balloons.“It’s been said that this is actually a performance art piece. It’s meant to represent . . . just universal peace,” said Erin, and an employee walked between the structure and the MacBook with an expression like everything but his mouth was grinning.“I noticed this employee is running a little,” said Paul following him to the second floor. “Does that mean something?”“Well, it’s sort of characteristic of our times,” said Erin.“Who are these people?” said Paul pointing at one of four preadolescent Caucasian girls in a blown-up photo on a wall.“These are all Cameron Diaz’s children,” said Erin.“Why are there spaces between this one’s teeth?”“Well, the meat fills in, then they put it into one burger.”“And the rest is just hair and stuff?”“That’s—actually, we shouldn’t reveal that,” said Erin.“And this is for . . . ten thousand chicken nuggets?” said  Paul pointing at the space of a missing tooth. “The gelatin required from the teeth.”“Yeah,” said Erin. “And actually for some . . . if you pay extra you can get a little bit of a tooth, from an actual child, and you can also get it memorialized, in a locket.”“If a country pays extra, their nuggets get more gelatin?”“Yes,” said Erin. “The quality is just slightly raised.”“I heard that Canada did that,” said Paul.“Um, just the Saskatchewan. They’re the prime testing markets. Because they eat . . . they primarily eat teeth there. That’s their diet, I didn’t know if you knew that.”“The Weakerthans wrote an album about that, right?”“Yeah, they—” said Erin.“Fallow?” said Paul.“Fallow,” said Erin confidently.“That was about the teeth—” said Paul.“The Saskatchewan teeth crisis,” said Erin.“This is where the district managers have their weekly meetings,” said Erin a few minutes later in a circular room—wallpapered with blown-up photos of children on bikes, and pogo sticks, in the foreground of a playground, at dusk—with a padded floor and, at its center, a playground of two slides, monkey bars, a pole, a tiny bridge. Paul said a girl had different eye sizes because she was on a “McFlurry-only diet” and asked Erin about a Hispanic girl wearing giant, padded headphones. “She’s actually producing right now,” said Erin. “She’s a producer.”“What’s her favorite McDonald’s meal?”“She just gets a side salad,” said Erin.“Are you serious?”“Yeah, that’s her thing,” said Erin pointing at what seemed  like an Ash Wednesday marking on her forehead. “See? She’s Zen.”“Let’s go to the opposite side of the spectrum: this girl.”“She gets six Big Macs,” said Erin about a pale, red-haired girl sitting in a sandbox. “She puts it all in the McFlurry machine. And the Oreos come down.”“Jesus. She puts it in the machine? This girl?”“She extracts the sauce from the Big Macs, and she puts that in a cup,” said Erin.“So she brings it home?”“It’s ‘on the go.’ She’ll just bring it anywhere.”“Then what?”“Then her interns are instructed to massage her, because she’s actually a candidate for the next McChicken sandwich.”“You could be eating her tomorrow,” said Paul to an imagined, future viewer of Taiwan’s First McDonald’s, and turned the MacBook to the girl with giant headphones. “You ate her. Now you might be eating the other one.” He panned the MacBook across half the room. “Or one of these, anyway.”“Can you talk about him?” said Erin about a chubby, closed-mouth smiling boy on a bike with training wheels, and took the MacBook. “You shouldn’t leave him out.”“Sure. This is one of the great failures of the Chicken McNugget raising program. This photo is actually . . . they told him he was supplying Thailand’s artificial flavoring from 2010 to 2020. He was really happy, which was his mistake.”“They’re actually going to tell her,” said Erin pointing at a girl, half obscured by a bored-looking dog, midair on a pogo stick. “She’s supplying Thailand until 2020, with a nonexclusive option at extending her contract.”“Nice,” said Paul.“She’s Miss Thailand,” said Erin.“This one doesn’t know he’s also going to be one,” said Paul about a boy on swings at the apex of his backward movement. “They’re all going to be one.”“Well, yeah. Someday.”“Even you,” said Paul.“I’m . . . uniquely . . .”“You know you’re going to be a Chicken McNugget.”“I’ve accepted it,” said Erin.They approached stairs—blocked by a dry mophead and what seemed to be a traffic cone—to a third floor, a few minutes later, ascending to a small dark room of additional seating, kaleidoscopically lit from outside sources through two windows.“It took them five years to Photoshop this,” said Paul pointing at the letter M inside a circle on a wall. “They had to wait for Adobe to answer a question they had, on a message board.”“The mother brain,” said Erin.“Shh,” whispered Paul tracing the circle with a forefinger.“Sorry,” whispered Erin. “The brainstorming process is in action.”“Jesus,” whispered Paul taking the MacBook carefully.“This is—” said Erin pointing at a pile of plastic-wrapped plastic utensils.“Leftovers,” said Paul.“—just the scraps of ideas that get sold to Burger King and Arby’s on eBay.”“Arby’s needs to update its credit card information.”“It will, it always does,” said Erin, and approached the darkest part of the room. “And here we have the brainchild, really, of this whole operation,” she said pointing at where the wall, due to lack of light, was indiscernible in color and texture.• • •“So, we’ve shown you what it’s about, and what it does, for the country,” said Paul in front of the Christmas tree. “Now let’s go over the main points again: one.”“Cameron Diaz’s foundation,” said Erin.“Two?”“One-A,” said Erin.“One-A?”“One-A,” said Erin. “And then one-B.”“Um,” said Paul grinning, and pointed at the third-floor windows. “We were there.”“The brainstorm. The conspiracy.”“And—remember this?” said Paul pointing at the Double Filet-O-Fish.“Yeah, whoa. Seems like so long ago.”“And then,” said Paul moving toward the entrance. “The performance art for world peace. Highly suggested.”“The, um,” said Paul noticing a headset-wearing employee inside McDonald’s, looking at him suspiciously, it seemed. “The arts sector.”“We didn’t do the drive-thru.”“Um,” said Paul distractedly.“One of the first, and worst, in Asia,” said Erin, and someone behind them said something that Paul didn’t comprehend. The person repeated himself. Paul turned around and the headset-wearing employee—a manager, it seemed—repeated himself again, in a sort of pleading voice.“We aren’t,” said Paul in Mandarin. “We’re only doing video. We finished.”The employee said “you can’t” in Mandarin and a word Paul didn’t comprehend.“We won’t,” said Paul in Mandarin. “There’s just us two only.”“Skype,” said Erin quietly.“Vacation,” said Paul, and the employee looked at Erin, then Paul. They were standing where cars, after ordering, would pass to get to the pickup window.“Oh, okay,” said the employee, and smiled a little and, after a pause, moved backward a few steps before turning around, walking away.“Vacation,” said Paul grinning.“Skype,” said Erin.“We’re on vacation,” said Paul.“Skype,” said Erin grinning, and they entered a dark, quiet, residential area of tall buildings behind McDonald’s, then briefly explored “one of the more glamorous alleyways in Taipei,” said Paul, before returning to McDonald’s “front yard,” where a young man wearing a scratched, black, melon-like helmet and thick-lensed glasses, standing at a bike rack, with two McDonald’s bags in his bike’s basket, stared carelessly into the distance as his hands, below him, fumbled idly with his bike lock, it seemed.“The binge in action,” said Erin. “Yet another successful binge operation.”“This is the best part of the binge. He’s imagining the nuggets. He’s already imagining his next trip. So much so that this is it . . . this is the next trip.”“The infinite loop of binge eating,” said Erin.“We’re looking at his mental projection of himself.”“We’re inside his brain right now.”“We’re looking at our creator,” said Paul grinning wildly.“Shit,” said Erin, and laughed. “That’s why he can’t move.” She noticed a few minutes later that the MacBook was “depleted,” a word they’d begun using to sympathetically reference anything that had temporarily exhausted a replenishable means.• • •On the way back to the apartment, to get a charger, they decided instead of a documentary to make a science-fiction movie, on the conceit that they existed because a young man in Taipei, while eating a bag of Chicken McNuggets, allowed himself (despite knowing this would definitely increase his unhappiness) to realistically imagine his next binge, when he would have two bags. Paul and Erin were constructed by the young man’s unconscious, for verisimilitude, as passersby in the peripheral vision of his imaginary next trip to McDonald’s. Their memories were not based on a concrete reality but on the meager imaginative powers—enough for only a very short-term, working memory—allotted for the “artificial intelligence” of peripheral passersby.Paul and Erin discussed their movie in a dialogue that sometimes overlapped with their inner monologues, which they sometimes introduced to the dialogue, or abandoned to focus on the dialogue, or both externalized, like pets into a shared space, to observe. That the universe was how it was, and that certain things seemed incomprehensible, that Paul couldn’t, without increasingly unexertable amounts of effort, remember what he didn’t store outside himself, as words, in books, that remembering seemed to require as much, or much more, energy as imagining, all seemed, while on LSD, in a context of science fiction, explainable in excitingly interconnected and true-seeming ways.At the apartment, around 1:30 a.m., they got a charger and Paul wrote a note to his mother that he and Erin were at McDonald’s or downstairs. They somehow didn’t remember they were on LSD, so didn’t discern and attribute the effects of LSD until, on their way to a different McDonald’s, crossing a street, Paul realized he was repeatedly becoming conscious of things in medias res, like the information he received from sensory perception wasn’t being processed immediately, but at a delay sometimes, resulting in microseconds to seconds of partial—but functioning—unconsciousness.At the McDonald’s where five employees had stood outside with megaphones and banners they sat in a corner on the second floor—the only two customers on the floor—and recorded more footage, using their iPhones, for their science-fiction movie. They regularly reminded each other that the LSD would soon start weakening, as it continued intensifying, to a degree that Paul could sense the presence of a metaphysical distance, from where, if crossed, he would not be able to return, therefore needed to focus, with deliberate effort, against a default drifting in that direction. Around 4:30 a.m. they walked twelve blocks to the apartment, holding hands and concentrating on and reminding each other of the task—to walk to the apartment without getting lost or hit by a car.They looked at the internet in a downstairs area until Paul’s parents woke, then showered and went outside to a sunny, warm morning. They lay on a suburban area of grass in front of a stadium by the apartment building, no longer excited or interested in their science-fiction movie, having forgotten or become tolerant toward its most exciting, beginning elaborations—discussed most intensely after Paul’s MacBook stopped recording. If they existed only in abstraction, as an unconscious aside in someone’s brain, this forgetting, indicative of decreasing interest, would be exactly what he would predict to happen, he weakly thought with predictably less interest and clarity, on his back, with eyes closed.• • •The next two times they ingested ecstasy they both felt what they termed “overdrive,” which for Paul was a whirring, metallic, noise-like presence that induced catatonia and rendered experience toneless—nullifying humor, irony, sarcasm, intimacy, meaning—so that he became like a robot that could discern (but not process, consider, or interrelate) concrete reality. Both times, after forty talkative minutes, Paul became silent and thoughtless and expressionless and suddenly disinterested in Erin and intensely—only sexually—interested in strangers and he tried masturbating in public bathrooms and couldn’t orgasm or feel pleasure, to any degree, as if lacking the concept, but felt continuously aroused “somewhere,” including sometimes, it seemed, outside his body, a few feet in front of him, or far in the distance, in a certain store or area of sky, or in an overlap, shifting in and out of his chest or head or the front of his face.Their brand of ecstasy, Erin learned from the internet, contained MDA, which they attributed—unconvincingly, because they’d previously enjoyed the same brand—as the cause of “overdrive.”One night, while sober, they were at a red light at a busy, quiet—unnaturally muffled, it seemed—intersection of a four-lane street and an eight-lane street, into the X of which a two-lane street asymmetrically stopped, as if the intersection had been built to memorialize where a traveler, by choice or not, had stopped going somewhere.Paul felt an oppressive sensation of being confined by the most distant things he could see in any direction, like after Michelle had walked away and he’d stood motionless in the rain, except then there’d also been a feeling of possibility, a glimmer of eagerness as he walked over the shiny, wet street, to return to the party. In an effort to distract from this feeling he asked, somewhat unexpectedly, what Erin was thinking—they’d stopped asking because it was always something depressing—and, with a slight grin, he saw peripherally, she said she’d been thinking that Paul needed to return her, like a broken appliance to a store, because she needed to be replaced with a newer, upgraded model. Paul stared ahead, wishing she hadn’t said that. “No,” he said grinning vaguely, unsure exactly how—but suspecting strongly that—their relationship due to what she’d said had changed in some notable, irreversible manner.The next night in a bookstore near Taipei 101, the third-tallest building in the world, an hour after ingesting MDMA, walking aimlessly with held hands, Paul “grimly,” he earnestly felt, asked what Erin was thinking about, and she said she was having paranoid thoughts again, “like maybe it’s not the drugs, maybe we just don’t have anything to talk about anymore.” Paul thought she was right, but argued against her by saying they had been spending too much time together—that, in his other relationships, one or both people would have work or school. They sat holding each other on the floor in the fiction section and decided to not ingest their remaining two ecstasy and to be apart from each other four hours a day. Paul was wearing a striped sweater he and Erin bought, a few days ago, solely because it was comically not his normal style.Manually descending a down escalator, about an hour later—holding Erin’s hand, leading them past people standing in place—Paul realized he was (and, for an unknown amount of time, had been) rushing ahead in an unconscious, misguided effort to get away from where he was: inside himself. Concurrent with this realization was an awareness of himself from a perspective thousands of feet above, plainly showing he was doing what he logically knew he did not want to do (that he dreaded doing, in the same way he dreaded  the remaining seconds on the down escalator, the minutes walking to the MRT station and waiting for the train, the six-minute walk from the station to the apartment, waiting for the elevator and lying in bed until an instantaneous transport to the next day’s minutes—was there no reprieve even in sleep?—he’d always felt comforted by sleep and now felt confused by it) and yet, even now, discerning this, kept doing what caused this realization.On Christmas Eve, when Erin returned from the bathroom and lay on the bed, ready to sleep, it seemed, Paul asked if she’d had any thoughts, since arriving in Taiwan, about showering.“Not really,” she said after a few seconds.“I noticed you don’t shower at night anymore. Or haven’t the last two nights.”“I don’t shower every night.”“You did . . . before Taiwan.”“I only shower at night if I noticeably smell,” said Erin. “There’ve been nights I haven’t, with you.”The next few minutes, sensing something combative and offendable in her—that he hadn’t before—Paul felt increasingly careful of his word choice and tone of voice. Erin stood, at some point, and was moving around the room. Paul said something about an area of the bed smelling bad, and Erin said “I’m stinky, all right, you’re right, I’ll go shower, I have stinky feet” loudly, and left the room, closing the door with force. When she returned, maybe ten minutes later, Paul’s heart was still beating considerably harder than normal and he immediately left the room. In the nearly pitch-black hallway Dudu’s wet nose softly touched the back of Paul’s leg, when they apparently moved in the same direction, toward the bathroom. In the shower Paul earnestly thought about  how to extricate himself from the marriage—what to do about their film company, how to behave the next ten days, what he and Erin would separately do each day, what to say to his parents—but when he returned to his room Erin apologized, which he hadn’t expected, and he reiterated that they’d happily agreed, a month ago, that if either person wanted the other to shower or brush their teeth, or anything like that, they’d state it immediately and directly and impersonally, instead of accumulating resentment.“There are things I’m still sensitive about,” said Erin.Paul said he had felt most upset by her sarcasm when she said she was stinky and how she left suddenly and sort of slammed the door. Erin said she had been joking, in an effort to downplay the situation, and hadn’t meant to slam the door. Paul said he hadn’t felt—or suspected, at all—that she was joking. Erin slept on her side facing away.In the morning Paul read an email from his mother, whose bedroom shared a wall with his, asking him to please try to be nicer to Erin, who remained on her side facing away, though she seemed awake. Paul showered for around forty-five minutes, continuing to mentally prepare to be single, and was unaware of the time until, after putting on clothes, his father said the taxi he’d called to drive them to the café hosting Paul’s reading—his mother was already there—was downstairs. Paul expected no response—or a begrudging one, maybe—as he explained to Erin, who was still facing away, in a voice he controlled to sound neutral that a taxi was waiting and that she didn’t have to go to his reading but it would be awkward if she didn’t because reservations had been made for dinner immediately after, in a nice restaurant, with many relatives, to celebrate their marriage. Paul felt emotional and surprised when, after a few seconds, during which her body  visibly relaxed, easing a tension Paul hadn’t discerned, Erin stood and softly said she didn’t know the reading was today and, prioritizing the situation, over her feelings, became accommodating and goal oriented, quickly and gracefully getting dressed and preparing to leave.In the taxi’s backseat, between Erin and his father, Paul pointed at a bright red, metal, pointy roof outside his father’s side’s window. “Look at that roof,” he said in Mandarin, and pushed a blue ecstasy into Erin’s mouth—against teeth, then inside, touching her tongue a little—while his father talked about slanted versus flat roofs. Paul, grinning convolutedly, pointed again and asked how to say “corrugated” in Mandarin and put their last ecstasy in his own mouth.Dinner, after the reading—with Paul’s parents, uncle, uncle’s girlfriend, uncle-in-law, great-uncle, two aunts, five cousins—was in a restaurant whose interior lighting, circuited into pillars and walls and the ceiling and bathrooms, though probably not in the kitchen, had been coordinated to undulate fluidly and cyclically, as one, yellow to red to purple to blue to green, seeming egregiously LSD themed.Paul’s father talked the most, by far, usually to no one specific, during the hour-long dinner. When he spoke people became attentive to him, but passively, at their leisure, with neutral expressions, as if watching an infomercial, neither annoyed nor entertained, feeling no obligation to respond or engage. Whenever he finished with a topic, sometimes to the accompaniment of his own laughter, people seemed to uniformly and inhumanly return, like foam mattresses, to how they were before, profoundly unfazed. At one point, in what seemed like a major faux pas, in part because Paul’s cousin’s father, Paul’s uncle, was present and seemed depressed, Paul’s father tried—for maybe five minutes, with no external feedback except two or three grunting noises from his target—to recruit Paul’s cousin, a few years older than Paul, to work for him selling lasers on commission. He’d tried the same, at previous dinners, with both Paul and Erin—and, at dinners last year, just Paul, who suspected his father felt as amused by his behavior, in this regard, as Paul and Erin, who’d said “your dad tried to recruit me to work for him” four or five times the past week.Paul’s relatives, though somewhat withdrawn and/or alienated from one another, seemed peaceful as a group, maybe because there didn’t appear to be any pressure for anyone to do anything they didn’t want to do, such as talk or smile. Paul’s mother and her older sister, best friends for decades, now seemed like polite, recent acquaintances who secretly disliked each other for admittedly irrational and/or superficial reasons.After dinner Paul and Erin followed Paul’s uncle and Paul’s uncle’s girlfriend to their car, to be driven, at Paul’s mother’s suggestion, to where young people went to buy clothes. Failing to operate a refrigerator-size parking meter, which Paul had never seen before, Paul’s uncle grinned and said something in Mandarin conveying idle bemusement regarding his decreasing ability to comprehend and maneuver himself through an increasingly surreal environment. In the BMW’s backseat Paul remembered, with embarrassment, when as a child, on the way to Ponderosa, in this car, his uncle suggested to Paul’s mother, his little sister, a restaurant that was the same as Ponderosa but used “fresher ingredients.” Paul’s mother had asked Paul, who had responded with a noise, causing six to ten relatives to eat at Ponderosa.Paul didn’t notice his uncle had turned around in his seat, and was grinning slightly, until he heard him say “you’re getting out here also” in Mandarin. The car was parked on the side of a street and Paul’s uncle’s girlfriend had gotten out.  Paul’s uncle, who spoke English fluently, congratulated Erin then carefully said two sentences to her and maybe Paul, who was remembering how he’d been surprised—and complicatedly moved—once when his uncle talked about buying and liking Michael Jackson’s music, in this car, after asking if Paul, who doesn’t remember what he answered, or how old he’d been, maybe 10 or 11, liked Michael Jackson.At the airport, after a silent taxi ride, around 7:30 a.m., Paul’s mother stood with Paul and Erin in line to check in luggage. Paul peripherally noticed his mother facing away, a little, with only her neck slightly turned. He looked at her and she turned her neck farther, so that he was looking at her looking elsewhere, then she turned, openly crying, toward him and said in a child-like but controlled voice that she was leaving before she started crying harder. She reflexively opened her mouth in a similar manner as when Paul had “caught” her, last year, putting sugar in her coffee, but the effect now was of further embarrassment, past helplessness, to disengagement, then withdrawal.Paul, whose eyes had become instantly watery, hadn’t seen her like this before. He thought of her mother, who had died before Paul was born—and was aware, with momentary clarity, which did not elucidate or console, but seemed to pointlessly reiterate, of how, in the entrance-less caves of themselves, everyone was already, always orphaned—and they briefly hugged and she hugged Erin and uncharacteristically left.

    "title": "LR: REMEMBER LAURA'S NAME AND ADD HER ON FACEBOOK",
    "text": "LR: REMEMBER LAURA'S NAME AND ADD HER ON FACEBOOK Tuesday, November 20, 2018 REMEMBER LAURA'S NAME AND ADD HER ON FACEBOOK When Paul woke, the next afternoon, Laura, 28, had already friended and messaged him on Facebook. She had a MySpace page, as an unsigned rapper, with six songs, including one whose music video, in which she rubs pizza on her face and feeds pizza to her cat, Paul remembered feeling highly amused and impressed by when he first saw it, when it had “gone viral,” to some degree, one or two years ago. In the library, that night, Paul discovered Gabby had defriended him on Facebook and was surprised that Kyle, his closest friend the past two years, except the nine months he was with Michelle, had also defriended him and that both had unfollowed him on Twitter.The next night, outside Taco Chulo, a Mexican restaurant in Williamsburg, Laura apologized for being late and said she’d gotten lost on the walk from her apartment, eight blocks away. Paul asked if she wanted to eat at Lodge, which had “good chicken fingers,” or Taco Chulo, as they’d previously agreed, and she seemed confused. In Taco Chulo a waiter said to sit “anywhere.” Paul watched Laura move very slowly, in a kind of exploring, it seemed, as if through darkness, to arrive at a four-person table, where once seated, with a slightly desperate expression, not looking at Paul, she focused on signaling a waiter. Paul also focused on signaling a waiter. Laura ordered a margarita, then sometimes turned her head 90 degrees, to her right, to stare outside—at the sidewalk, or the quiet street—with a self-consciously worried expression, seeming disoriented and shy in a distinct, uncommon manner indicating to Paul an underlying sensation of “total yet failing” (as opposed to most people’s “partial and successful”) effort, in terms of the social interaction but, it would often affectingly seem, also generally, in terms of  existing. Paul had gradually recognized this demeanor, the past few years, as characteristic, to some degree, of every person, maybe since middle school, with whom he’d been able to form a friendship or enter a relationship (or, it sometimes seemed, earnestly interact and not feel alienated or insane). After finishing a second margarita Laura became attentive and direct, like she’d been at the party, when she had been probably very drunk, Paul realized.“You have a girlfriend?” said Laura, surprised.“No,” said Paul, confused. “Why?”“You said ‘my girlfriend.’ ”Paul said he meant “ex-girlfriend.” Laura said she’d thought he was “a Gaylord,” because at the party he’d been surrounded by males, which someone had called his “fans.” Paul said the party was “like, seventy percent males” and that he had always thought the word “Gaylord” had been invented by someone in middle school for derogatory purposes by combining “gay” and “lord.” When he showed Laura prints of his art (which, according to StatCounter, she’d already seen on one of his websites), she seemed to reflexively feign seeing them for the first time: her eyes, upon sight, became and remained slightly unfocused and she made a noise indicating she was seeing something new, but when he asked if she’d seen them before she said “yeah,” but seemed to continue feigning “no.” Paul, endeared by her extreme and complicated helplessness, took back his art and focused conversation on other topics. They agreed to leave, but continued talking for around forty-five minutes, inviting each other to parties that weekend. Paul felt a kind of panic when they realized the parties were the same night and said “I don’t know what to do” and “maybe they aren’t on the same night.” Laura said they could go to both parties—which seemed immediately obvious—and asked if Paul wanted to go to K&M, where her friend was DJ-ing. Paul carefully said he  did, then went to the bathroom, thinking that for matters involving social interaction he shouldn’t trust himself, at this time, after being mostly alone for around six months.In K&M—empty except for the DJ, bartender, two other people—they each drank two shots of tequila and sat with glasses of beer in a booth, side by side, facing a giant screen showing Half Baked on mute with subtitles. Laura complimented Paul’s hair and level of “casualness” and, going partially under the table, held a candle toward Paul’s shoes—which from Paul’s above-table perspective felt stationary and storage-oriented as shoe boxes—asking what brand they were.“iPath,” said Paul.“I can’t see. What are these?”“iPath. The brand is iPath.”“I like them,” said Laura.“iPath,” said Paul quietly.Laura said her ex-boyfriend was in a band and used heroin and they already stopped seeing each other, but it was “ongoing,” for example he asked her to a movie last week and she went and it was awkward. “I just wish he would disappear,” she said in a sincere-seeming manner, staring at Half Baked, which Paul saw on her right eye as four to six pixels that sometimes changed colors. Laura said she didn’t want to talk about her ex-boyfriend. Paul asked if she’d tried heroin and she said no, but liked painkillers, then nuzzled his shoulder with her head. When he said he had a headache and drugs in his room and asked if she wanted to go there, she seemed instantly distracted (as a reflexive tactic, Paul felt, to not appear too eager) and expressed indecision a few minutes, then said she also had a headache, then directly stated, more than once—in an openly and uncaringly, Paul felt with amusement, confirmation-seeking manner indicating  her previous indecision was at least partly feigned—that she wanted to go to Paul’s room to ingest his drugs.Outside, after fifteen minutes of failing to get a taxi, they began walking purposelessly, both saying they didn’t know the correct direction to Paul’s apartment, maybe twenty blocks away. Paul’s arms felt more tired, from signaling taxis, than “in five years, maybe,” he estimated aloud. They got in a minivan taxi, which after a few minutes dropped them off near the center of a shadowy, tree-heavy intersection.The address was correct, according to the street sign, but Paul didn’t recognize anything, even after turning two full circles while dimly aware, in a detached manner reminding him of his drunkenness, that his behavior’s dizzying effects might be counterproductive. He heard Laura, somewhat obligatorily, he thought, say she was scared, then said he was a little scared, then in a louder voice, as if correcting himself, said he was confused. His inability to recognize anything began to feel like a failure of imagination, an inability to process information creatively. His conscious, helpless, ongoing lack of recognition—his shrinking, increasingly vague context—seemed exactly and boringly like how it would feel to die, or to have died. He felt like he was disappearing. He was aware of having said “is there another Humboldt Street, or something,” when he realized he was—already, without a feeling or memory of recognition—looking at the bronze gate, thirty to forty feet away, of the walkway to the four-story house in which, in an apartment on the second floor, he shared a bathroom and kitchen with Caroline, an administrative assistant at the New School with an MFA in poetry.In Paul’s room Laura tried to identify some of his fifteen to twenty pills and tablets, mostly from Charles, who had mailed them before leaving for Mexico, with her phone but the internet wasn’t working. Paul’s MacBook, which he’d spilled iced coffee on, was in Kansas being affordably repaired. Laura swallowed two of what Paul knew was Tylenol 3. Paul swallowed a Percocet and, somewhat arbitrarily, he felt, three Advil, then turned off the light, saying it was hurting his headache.Paul was aware, as they lay kissing in the dark on his mattress, of Laura petting his upper arm in a manner that seemed independent of their kissing (but, he dimly intuited, because they were of the same source, must be discernibly related, on some level, if only as contributors to some larger system). Laura wanted to continue kissing but couldn’t breathe, she said, because her nose was stuffy. “I’m sorry, I don’t want to be needy,” she said a few minutes later. “But I can’t sleep without noise, like a fan.” Paul turned on the bathroom vent. Caroline turned it off a few minutes later. Paul turned it on and texted Caroline his situation and that he would pay five dollars to keep it on tonight.[LAURA] Posted by Nate at 6:59 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Home"

    "title": "LR: LAURA",
    "text": "LR: LAURA Tuesday, November 20, 2018 LAURA Paul woke on his back, with uncomfortably warm feet, in a bright room, not immediately aware who or where he was, or how he had arrived. Most mornings, with decreasing frequency, probably only because the process was becoming unconscious, he wouldn’t exactly know anything until three to twenty seconds of passive remembering, as if by unzipping a file—newroom.zip—into a PDF, showing his recent history and narrative context, which he’d delete after viewing, thinking that before he slept again he would have memorized this period of his life, but would keep newroom.zip, apparently not trusting himself.Paul read a text from Laura asking if he wanted to see Trash Humpers tonight. Paul texted he already saw it, and they made plans to record a song in his room in two hours.Laura arrived with Walter, whom Paul hadn’t expected, two hours late and reacted to Paul’s agitation, as they walked from the bronze gate to the house, with resentment and dismissiveness, then became a little apologetic in Paul’s room, showing him texts she’d sent to Walter telling him to hurry.“You can’t blame me,” said Walter, and chuckled. “I don’t even know why I’m here. You suddenly just started texting me to drive you here.”“Now everyone is turning against me,” said Laura smiling nervously, not looking at anyone. Paul asked Walter if it was true, as he’d thought he’d read on Gawker, that Detroit, where Walter was from, only had seven grocery stores. Walter laughed quietly and said that wasn’t true and that Detroit was comparable, he felt, to Ann Arbor maybe. Paul said he was going to Ann Arbor in September, for his book tour, and asked what size it was, and was peripherally aware of Laura turning away, like she’d observed the interaction and concluded something, as she said “now you’re going to ask Walter a lot of questions.”“It’s like Berkeley,” said Walter.“It’s that big?” said Paul in a dreamy voice, and moved, vaguely for privacy, from the mattress to the floor, where he texted Daniel and ingested a Klonopin, weakly thinking “it won’t begin working until I won’t need it as much anymore.” Walter and Laura, who had brought a tambourine and a shaker, talked idly, a few feet from Paul, who thought Walter’s grumpiness after leaving Kyle and Gabby’s party, when he’d wielded a Red Bull Soda, now seemed endearing. Paul noticed Laura looking at his pile of construction paper and said she could have some if she wanted, and she focused self-consciously on wanting some, saying how she would use it and what colors she liked, seeming appreciative in an affectedly sincere manner—the genuine sincerity of a person who doesn’t trust her natural behavior to appear sincere. Paul went outside and opened the bronze gate and laughed a little when Daniel said he should “grow an enormous afro without any warning” for his next author photo and they sat on the front stoop. The late-afternoon sky, in Paul’s peripheral vision, panoramic and mostly unobstructed, appeared rural or suburban, more indicative of forests and fields and lakes—of nature’s vast connections, through the air and the soil, to more of itself—than of outer space, which was mostly what Paul thought of when beneath an urban sky, even in daytime, especially in Manhattan, between certain buildings, framing sunless zones of upper atmosphere, as if inviting space down to deoxygenate a city block. Walter exited the house and mentioned a party in Chelsea and left. Laura exited a few minutes later, meekly holding her tambourine and shaker and some construction paper. “I see you ‘got in on’ the construction paper,” said Paul in the sarcastic, playful voice he’d used to recommend Funyuns the night they met, but with a serious expression. “Good choices, in terms of colors. Good job.”“You said I could have some,” said Laura hesitantly.“I know,” said Paul. “I’m glad you got some.”“Well, I’m going home now,” said Laura with a shy expression, not looking at anyone.• • •Paul hadn’t seen Laura alone since she slept over, five days ago, when he brought a mix CD and Ambien to her room, which was more than half occupied by a full-size bed. She offered him red wine she was drinking from a wineglass and typed “sex tiger woods” into Google and clicked dlisted.com. Adjacent to a photo of Tiger Woods, smiling on a golf course, were blocks of text, in which “Ambien sex haze” was in bold around ten times.Laura typed “ambient” into Google.“No,” said Paul grinning. “That’s the music, delete the t.”Laura laughed and typed “ambien and alcohol and klonopin and” and grinned at Paul and, though she had a Klonopin prescription, Paul knew, and was probably on Klonopin, said “just kidding” and deleted all but “ambien and alcohol.” Every result, it seemed, warned strongly against combining Ambien and alcohol, but Laura said she drank “a lot,” so it would be okay. Paul crawled onto her bed and touched her cat Jeffrey and, after a vague amount of time, became aware of a slight blurriness to his vision, like he was seeing from two perspectives in time, milliseconds apart, and that he felt vaguely sleepy and not nervous. He asked if Laura could turn off the light, which seemed uncomfortably bright. He felt confused, to some degree, by everything, but at a delay, as if continuously realizing past confusions, which could no longer be resolved, so were not problems. They seemed to be watching a foreign movie off her computer, then Paul noticed the light was on and that they were lying against a mound of blankets, kissing lazily, with eyes closed and long pauses, maybe sometimes asleep. He became aware of his mix CD, of some of his favorite songs, sounding unpleasantly, almost nightmarishly, noise-like. Paul realized they were trying to undo his belt and weakly imagined what would happen if his jeans were removed and heard Laura say “we just met” from what seemed like a nearby, inaccessible distance and wondered if he was asleep, or dreaming, but knew he was awake, because he was moving physically. He was trying to remove Laura’s clothing. He felt like he was trying to remove the surface of a glass bottle by pawing at it with oven mitts. He expressed confusion and Laura said “it’s just a skirt . . . and tights” and stopped moving completely, it seemed, as Paul continued touching her strange outfit with hands that felt glossy and fingerless, suspecting at one point, with some sarcasm, that she was wearing a corset.“It’s been two hours, I think,” said Paul after staring at his phone around ten seconds. “Jesus,” he said, and sneezed.[GO TO LUCIE'S PARTY] Posted by Nate at 7:07 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "LR: GO TO LUCIE'S PARTY",
    "text": "LR: GO TO LUCIE'S PARTY Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO TO LUCIE'S PARTY Entering Lucie’s party, an hour and a half later, Paul felt like if he wasn’t careful he would fall in an out-of-control, top-heavy manner toward whomever he was greeting and hurt himself and multiple others by reflexively grabbing people and pulling them down with him in a continuing effort to remain standing. He realized he might be unconsciously hunching his back, to be nearer the floor, when Lucie, though four or five inches shorter, appeared to be above him as she thanked him for linking her magazine on his blog. Paul introduced Lucie and other people to Laura by saying “this is Laura” a few times without looking at anyone’s face, while moving toward areas with less people. “Hey,” said Paul, as he passed Mitch in a crowded space, and mumbled something about “going somewhere,” which in combination with a peremptory nodding was meant to convey they would definitely talk at length, later tonight, since they hadn’t seen each other in a long time—months, maybe.In an empty kitchen, a few seconds later, Paul realized Mitch, who worked for Zipcar, had driven him and Laura—and others—to this party. Paul stared into a refrigerator, bent at his waist, waiting for himself, it seemed, to think or do something. “Trying to choose two beers,” he thought after a vague amount of time, and chose two at random, then found Laura and went with her through a window, onto a fourth-story roof, where they passed a shadowy area, emanating the language-y noises and phantom heat of four to six people, to a higher area, where they were alone. Paul, dangling his legs briefly off the building, scooted backward, passively cooperative, as a distracted-seeming Laura pulled him away  from the edge. They sat facing hundreds of the same type of four-story building, the expanse of which, in most directions, darkened dramatically, creating an illusion that one could see the Earth’s curvature, until blurring, in the distance, into a texture. Sometimes, looking at a city, especially a gray or brown one, at night, Paul would intuitively view it as a small and irreducible thing that arrived one summer and rapidly grew, showing patterns of color on its expanding surface, then was discolored by autumn and removed of its exterior and deadened by winter, in preparation for regrowth, in spring, but was unable, in its form, to enter the natural cycle, so continued growing, in a manner as if faceless and skinless, through summer, autumn, etc., less in belligerence or tyranny, or with some abstruse knowledge of its own rightness, than as a stranded thing, sightless and uninstructed, with an objectless sort of yearning. Seeing the streets and bridges and sidewalks, while living inside a building, locked in a room, one could forget that it was all a single, alien, seeking entity.Paul realized he and Laura had been staring into the distance—unaware of each other, it seemed—for maybe two or three minutes. He looked at her profile. Without moving her head, in a voice like she was still considering if this was true, she said Paul was “devious” for bringing her to a party where another girl liked him.“What girl likes me?”“Lucie,” said Laura after a few seconds, still staring ahead, systematically reinterpreting her and Paul’s prior interactions, it seemed, with this new information.“Why do you think she likes me?”“I can tell,” said Laura, and lit a cigarette.“She has a boyfriend,” said Paul.Laura said something seemingly unrelated about cooking.“You should cook for me,” said Paul distractedly.“You won’t like it—it’ll be dense and unhealthy.”“I like pasta and lasagna,” said Paul, and thought he heard Laura ask if his computer was in Canada and was nervous she might be confusing him for another person. “What computer?”“You said your computer was getting fixed in Canada.”“Oh,” said Paul. “Kansas, not Canada. Yeah, it’s still there.”On their way back inside Paul and Laura passed the shadowy area, from where an unseen Amy said something implying Laura had stolen her cigarettes, using the word “cute” antagonistically. Paul had an urge to accelerate, but Laura, ahead of him, continued at her leisurely pace, maneuvering carefully through the window, into the kitchen.Paul followed a slow-moving Laura through a long, dark, almost boomerang-shaped hallway, which felt briefly room-like, as they sort of lingered in it, or like it wanted to be a room, with furniture and guests, but maybe was shy and too afraid of causing disappointment, so impaired itself with two conspicuous openings to conventionally shaped rooms, a sort of recommendation against itself. Paul and Laura entered a large room of sofas and tables and eight to twelve people, including Daniel, who encouraged Paul to “test-drive” a foot-massage machine, which was on the floor, audibly bubbling hot water.“Take off your shoes and socks,” said Daniel.“I don’t want to use that,” said Paul, and turned around and distractedly sat on a backless, deeply padded, uncomfortable seat, which yielded at least a foot from Paul’s weight. Laura was ten feet away, in a throne-like chair, facing Paul, but not looking at him, or anyone, it seemed. Paul openly  stared at her for around ten seconds, to no response, then moved chips and guacamole onto his lap (partly because he felt anxious about Laura seeming to refuse to look at him) and focused on steadily eating while repeatedly thinking “eating chips and guacamole.” He looked at his hands, and felt his mouth and throat, doing what he was thinking, and felt vaguely confused. Was he instructing his brain? Or was he narrating what he saw and felt?Laura seemed less distracted, but more worried, than before. Paul moved toward her with what felt like a precariously sustained gliding motion and sat against and above her, on the chair’s sturdy armrest, in a comically awkward manner he hadn’t foreseen and was preparing to reverse, by returning to his seat, when Laura lifted his arm and placed it ungently around her neck—maybe a little disappointed that she had to do it herself—where it remained, independent and heavy as a small boa constrictor, for a vague amount of time, during which Paul, remaining almost completely still, felt increasingly reluctant to move, or speak. At some point, maybe three minutes later, Paul asked if Laura wanted to go to the other party.“Yes,” she said.Paul felt like parts of his and Laura’s bodies, as they stood on the front stoop hugging tightly under one umbrella, waiting for Walter’s car, were oppositely charged magnets covered with thick velvet. Paul crawled into Walter’s car’s backseat, spilling red wine; unable to find the cork, he wrapped the bottle in a plastic bag. He faced ahead, seated between two people, and realized no one had cared, or noticed, at all, it seemed, about the wine. Paul thought “I’m in hell” when people began to loudly mimic the guitar parts of the  Led Zeppelin playing from a tape deck, resulting mostly in demonic-sounding noises and a kind of metallic, nightmarish screeching. Paul couldn’t discern if they did this regularly, or if it had just been improvised. “Ambien has a negative effect on music for me,” he thought.At Laura’s friend’s party Paul sat alone at the snacks table, eating crackers and drinking wine, sometimes with unfocused eyes. Then he was sitting on a mattress in a space-module-like bedroom, in which six to ten people, smoking marijuana, watched a video off a MacBook of obese people screaming in pain earnestly while exercising and being screamed at motivationally, in what seemed to be a grotesque parody, or something, of something. Paul felt strong aversion to the video, and also like he’d already experienced this exact situation—he remembered his aversion to the video and the way someone to his right was laughing—and wanted to ask if this already happened, but didn’t know who to ask, then realized he wanted to ask himself. Around an hour later, after more crackers and wine, Paul thought he heard Laura drunkenly say something like “let him through, my new boyfriend,” loud enough for probably ten to fifteen people to have heard, as she beckoned him to sit with her and her three closest friends, including Walter, on a four-seat sofa. Walter drove everyone on the sofa to Laura’s apartment to smoke marijuana, around 3:30 a.m., when the party ended.On the sidewalk, outside Laura’s apartment, a heavily impaired Paul explained that in high school his lungs collapsed three times and one of the doctors said smoking marijuana would increase the chance of recurrence by 4,200 percent. Laura said he wouldn’t have to smoke. Paul said the smoke would be in the air and that he was allergic to Laura’s cat and had a horrible headache. He hugged Laura, then walked toward the Bedford L train station, half a block away.• • •The next night Laura emailed that she wished Paul wasn’t allergic to Jeffrey so he could be with her, in her room, listening to the rain. Paul asked if she wanted to eat dinner together tomorrow night. Laura said she felt like she missed him and “well, I guess I’ll see you tomorrow,” characteristically answering a question indirectly and ending an email casually.Paul was aware he felt mysteriously less interested in her after reading that she felt like she missed him and realized he hadn’t considered what a relationship between them would be like: probably not sustainable, at all, due to a mutual lack of strong interest. He was aware of not acknowledging her line about missing him in his response, which included a short list of restaurants he liked.[LAURA...] Posted by Nate at 7:11 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "LR: LAURA...",
    "text": "LR: LAURA... Tuesday, November 20, 2018 LAURA... Paul met Laura the next night outside the clothing boutique in SoHo where she worked. “I think this is a bad idea, I always go home after work to nap,” she said with a worried expression, walking slowly away from Paul, who signaled a taxi, which they exited fifteen blocks later at a deli, where they bought a 40oz and two bottles of beer.Seated, in Angelica Kitchen, they looked at each other directly for the first time that night. Laura seemed anxious and tired. Paul said the restaurant was organic and vegan and Laura said she had been trying to eat better since meeting Paul, who grinned while saying “you’ve been trying to eat butter?” twice, during which Laura began to blush.“I thought you said ‘butter,’ ” said Paul grinning.Laura looked at her hand touching a fork on the table.“I thought you said you’re trying to eat butter.”“Stop,” said Laura moving the fork slowly toward herself.“Stop what?”“You’re making fun of me, I think,” said Laura looking at him tentatively.“No, I’m not. I wouldn’t do that.”Laura was motionless, looking at her lap with downcast eyes, like she was waiting for Paul to finish. Paul asked if she believed him and she didn’t respond and he felt stranded and withering and asked again if she believed him, then quietly said “I honestly thought you said ‘butter.’ ” He nervously moved a spoon to his lap and, aware they were both looking down, felt himself absorbing the irresolution of the butter misunderstanding as an irreversible damage. He asked if she wanted to leave, for a different restaurant maybe. Laura poured beer from the 40oz into Paul’s glass, already 95 percent full, and said “let’s just drink more, I just need to drink more” and apologized for “being like this.”“It’s okay,” said Paul. “I’m sorry about the butter thing.”Laura blushed and looked down by slowly moving her eyeballs. Paul apologized and said he wouldn’t talk about it anymore and that he liked Laura’s eyebrows, which were black, in contrast to her naturally blond hair. They talked tensely, with a few long pauses, about the difference between Scottish and Irish people and Paul began to worry about the rest of dinner, but after they finished the 40oz and mutely focused on their menus a few minutes they settled into a calm, polite, somewhat resigned manner of leisurely occupying each other. When their mashed potatoes, chili, corn-bread, noodle soup arrived they talked less and Paul began to feel a little sleepy. Laura thanked him for showing her this restaurant, which she wanted to try lunch from soon.Outside, on the sidewalk, Laura immediately walked toward the 1st Avenue L train station at an unleisurely pace, seeming  less rushed than resolutely continuing with a prior, focused, unobstructed momentum. Paul realized, with some confusion, that he’d obliviously assumed they would do something together after dinner; more than once, as they waited for the bill, he’d considered suggesting they see a movie at a theater that was in the opposite direction they were currently walking. Laura was crossing streets and sidewalks at unconventional angles, as if across a field, in a diagonal, it seemed, to get there sooner. Paul wanted to stop moving and sit or lay on the sidewalk, partly as a juvenile tactic to interrupt Laura’s departure.On the train Laura became significantly more talkative and, it seemed, happier. Paul thought of how at every job he’d had, in movie theaters and libraries and restaurants, almost every employee, probably especially himself, would become predictably friendlier and more generous as closing time neared. At the Bedford station, before exiting the train, Laura apologized again and unsolicitedly said “maybe I’ll feel better and come over later, in a few hours,” which seemed to Paul like a non sequitur, or an extreme example of the “closing time” effect.In his room, with the light on, Paul lay entirely beneath his blanket, aware that Michelle was the last person who’d affected him this cripplingly—to zero productivity, not even listening to music, motionless between his blanket and mattress like some packaged thing. He heard a ringing noise, or the memory of a ringing noise, which meant another of his limited number of nonregenerative hearing cells had died, though his room was nearly silent. He became aware of himself remembering a night when he and Michelle, alone in her mother’s mansion-like house in Pittsburgh, made salad and pasta for dinner and sat facing each other, bisecting a  long wood table like a converted canoe. Paul had begun to feel depressed without knowing why—maybe unconsciously intuiting what life would be like in a giant house with a significant other and a routine, how forty or fifty years, like windows on a computer screen, maximized on top of each other, could appear like a single year that would then need to be lived repeatedly, so that one felt both nearer and withheld from death—and within a few minutes was silent and visibly troubled, staring down at his salad. Michelle had asked what was wrong and Paul had said “nothing,” then she’d asked again and he’d said he felt depressed, but didn’t know why, then at some point she went upstairs, where Paul found her on her bed, in her room that seemed too big for one person, in a fetal position on her side—oval and exposed, on top of her sheets and blanket, as an egg. Paul dreamed something about his cube-shaped room being a storage facility in which he’d been placed by an entity that believed in his resale value. While in storage he could interact with others, look at the internet, go on a book tour, but if he damaged himself he would be moved to a garbage pile, on a different planet. He woke a few times, then remained awake, obstructed from sleep by his own grumpiness and discomfort, the main reasons he wanted to sleep.He reached outside his blanket and pulled his MacBook “darkly,” he felt, toward himself, like an octopus might. It was 12:52 a.m., almost three hours since leaving Angelica Kitchen. Laura, to Paul’s surprise, had emailed twice—a few sentence fragments apologizing for her awkwardness at 11:43 p.m., a paragraph of elaboration at 12:05 a.m. Paul emailed that he understood and liked her and thought she was “cool.” She responded, a few minutes later, seeming cheerful. After a few more emails she seemed almost “giddy.” They committed—earnestly and enthusiastically, Paul felt—to get tattoos together tomorrow.• • •Laura arrived around 4:30 p.m., seeming tired and distracted, with cheese and a bottle of wine and knitting materials in a plastic bag. Paul said they should go to Manhattan before night and Laura asked why and Paul said for tattoos. Laura said she wanted to stay inside to work on her set of a dozen “monster masks,” which she wanted to use in a music video for one of her songs (and which, based on photos Paul had seen on the internet, she seemed to have been knitting for more than a year). They shared a Klonopin, and when it began to get dark outside Paul suggested a restaurant two blocks away, but Laura didn’t want to go outside, so they ordered Chinese food—minnow-size pieces of slippery chicken in a shiny garlic sauce, six fortune cookies—and ate only a little, then shared an Ambien and sat, at a distance from each other, on Paul’s mattress.Paul patted the area beside him and Laura said “stop trying to make sexy time” in an earnest, slightly annoyed voice. Paul grinned and honestly said he wasn’t and felt confused. Laura, who had finished most of the bottle of wine herself, lay curled in a corner of the mattress and was soon asleep. Paul absently looked at the internet a little, then woke, three hours later, around midnight, to Laura putting her things into her plastic bag. She was going home, she said, because she had to feed Jeffrey and had work in the morning.[GO BACK TO SLEEP] Posted by Nate at 7:13 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "LR: GO BACK TO SLEEP",
    "text": "LR: GO BACK TO SLEEP Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO BACK TO SLEEP The next few days they texted regularly and, Paul felt, with equal attentiveness. Paul texted a photo of a display in the Mall of America of books titled I Can Make You Confident and I Can Make You Sleep with the author grinning on each cover. Laura texted a blurry photo of what seemed to be a headless mannequin wearing a suit and positioned in a begging or praying pose. Then she texted less, and with less attention, and one night didn’t respond to a photo Paul sent from a café of a Back to the Future poster— He was never in timefor his classes . . .He wasn’t in timefor his dinner . . .Then one day . . .he wasn’t in histime at all.—until morning, when she texted “lol” and that she’d been asleep, but she didn’t reciprocate a photo, or ask a question, so they stopped texting. Paul sensed she was busy with music projects and maybe one or more vague relationships, and allowed himself to become “busy” also, to some degree, with other things, like organising his upcoming tour. Paul hadn't seen Laura for almost four weeks when, at a party with Caroline, he found Laura had deactivated her Facebook. Paul met Taryn, a friend of Caroline and Shawn Olive’s, and became gradually—almost unnoticeably—intrigued by their interactions. They rarely talked and never touched but remained, for some reason, near each other, as if one was the other’s manager or personal assistant, but neither knew their role and could only study the other for clues, which they seemed to do, gazing at each other anthropomorphically, for seconds at a time, surprisingly without awkwardness, then she seemed to disappear and was quickly forgotten. Paul sat with strangers on a crowded staircase and drank beer while looking at his phone, sometimes staring at its screen for ten to twenty seconds without thinking anything, before maneuvering through a crowded hallway into a medium-size room. After one beer Paul texted Laura “hi, how’s it going” and interpreted her almost instantaneous response of “super” as her wanting to finish an undesirable task as quick as possible. Paul texted he was at a party with “art school friends” and if Laura wanted to come. Laura texted “I’m all out of art” after five minutes. Paul texted “I have some art for you” with a neutral expression and a cringing sensation, then showed Caroline and Taryn the texts, saying he felt depressed. In the living room, around twenty-five people were dancing to loud music with faces that seemed expressive in an emotionless, hidden, bone-ward manner—the faces of people with the ability to stop clutching the objects of themselves and allow their brains, like independent universes with unique and inconstant natural laws, to react, like trees to wind, with their bodies to music.Paul walked directly to a two-seat sofa (golden brown and deeply padded as the upturned paw of an enormous stuffed animal) and lay on it, on his side, facing the room, and closed his eyes. After a blip of surprise, which disintegrated in some chemical system of Klonopin and Valium and alcohol instead of articulating into what would’ve startled Paul awake—that he’d fluently, with precision and total calm, entered a room of dozens of people and lain facing outward on a sofa—was asleep. When he woke, an unknown amount of time later—  between five and forty minutes, or longer—he observed neutrally that, though he was drooling a little and probably the only non-dancing person in the room, no one was looking at him, then moved toward the room’s iPod with the goal-oriented, zombie-like calmness of a person who has woken at night thirsty and is walking to his refrigerator and changed the music to “Today” by the Smashing Pumpkins. Every person, it seemed, stopped dancing and appeared earnestly annoyed but—as if to avoid encouraging the behavior—didn’t look at Paul or say anything and, when the music was changed back, resumed dancing, like nothing had happened. Paul looked at his phone—it had been more than an hour since he texted Laura that he had art and, as expected, she hadn’t responded—and heard Caroline say “a Mexican place” and something about “six tacos” to Shawn Olive.[FIND LAURA] Posted by Nate at 7:20 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Older Post Home"

    "title": "L: FIND LAURA",
    "text": "L: FIND LAURA Wednesday, November 21, 2018 FIND LAURA Over the next two weeks Paul attempted to communicate with Laura through email and sometimes on the phone. In early June, Paul received a text from Laura saying Jeffrey had disappeared and that she had been depressed and hadn’t been eating, was now living in upstate New Jersey with her mother and had written Paul a giant letter. In her letter Laura told Paul her mother wanted her to move to Baltimore and live with her aunt, uncle and cousin and to reenroll at Notre Dame of Maryland University, where she had dropped out as a sophomore. Laura said her mother was a “somewhat fucked” person and had made her recount details about her time in New York, details about her and Paul's drug use and things like how they only had sex once in New York, and that her mother didn’t seem to think Paul only wanted sex but had said Laura couldn't see him until she was off her Klonopin prescription, at least. Laura’s mother was a graphic designer for America’s largest-circulation tow-truck magazine. Laura had to go with her to work every day because she thought Laura would run away if left alone. Laura said that she was in group therapy with her mother and when the therapist asked her mother what exactly her problem was with Laura being in New York, her mother was quiet and then said she didn’t know. “The therapist defeated my mother,” said Laura. Paul said Laura should tell the therapist he was a graduate of New York University. Laura said she did and the therapist was impressed and said something nice about New York University. Paul said the only purpose of going to New York University was so Laura could now say to her therapist in the presence of her mother that Paul had gone to New York University. After eleven days of not receiving a reply, Paul was at the Library editing e-mails to Laura he had written but not sent.

    "title": "L: PREPARE FOR PRELIMINARY READING TOUR IN MONTREAL AND TORONTO",
    "text": "L: PREPARE FOR PRELIMINARY READING TOUR IN MONTREAL AND TORONTO Wednesday, November 21, 2018 PREPARE FOR PRELIMINARY READING TOUR IN MONTREAL AND TORONTO In Montreal, three days later, beneath a uniformly cloudy expanse, which glowed with the same intensity and asbestos-y texture everywhere, seeming less like a sky than the cloud-colored surface of a cold, hollowed-out sun, close enough to obstruct its own curvature, Paul walked slowly and aimlessly, sometimes standing in place, like an arctic explorer, noticing almost no other people and that something, on a general level, seemed familiar. He drank coffee and looked at the internet in a café, feeling gloomy and vertiginous when, after three hours, he went outside, where it had gotten significantly colder, to walk to a juice bar, twelve blocks away,  near the café where the world’s largest French-language radio station was interviewing him in an hour.The sky darkened and was now almost cloudless, like it had been gently suctioned from an interplanetary pressure system. As a red truck, clean and bright as a toy, passed on the street, Paul realized Montreal, with its narrower streets and cute beverage sizes and smaller vehicles, reminded him of Berlin. He’d gone alone to Berlin early in his relationship with Michelle for the German edition of his first novel—a year and a half ago, in March 2009, he calculated after two to three minutes of focused effort containing two long pauses without thoughts, but it felt more than five years away, like part of himself, while in Berlin, had gotten lost on its way here, taking more than five years instead of one and a half, a feeling that confused Paul, who stopped thinking, then realized he hadn’t thought about Laura, or maybe any person, today and that he had no romantic prospects. He visualized the black dot of the top of his head—from an aerial view of two blocks—slowing to a standstill and remaining motionless on the sidewalk as other dots passed in either direction and the darkening city gradually brightened with artificial lights, the movie of his life finally ending, the credits scrolling down the screen.Shivering, he walked with increasing speed toward the juice bar, wanting to stop moving in a way that he’d disappear, which didn’t seem possible. He ingested two capsules of MDMA with a green smoothie, then walked four blocks to a café where he was interviewed by a small, balding, frequently laughing man of indiscernible age for around forty-five minutes, during which Paul smiled uncontrollably, with almost continuously unfocused eyes, unable to discern stillness in the single image of everything, containing him in a sphere of blurrily passing scenery. He felt low in his seat, warming  his hands on a cup of tea, and was sometimes aware that his face was arbitrarily pointing in strange directions, as if to consider his thoughts, or the interviewer’s questions, from various perspectives, probably seeming genuinely eccentric or weirdly, insanely pretentious. His teeth chattered and his upper body sometimes “convulsed,” he thought with brief interest, on the walk to the Drawn & Quarterly bookstore, where he sat absently in the audience in the back row with a slouched posture and, with a sensation of entering his body in medias res, at a moment when a decision, approved without his input, was about to actualize, said “is David Foster Wallace really big in America?” at a speaking volume to no one, it seemed.Five or six people, ahead of him, facing the stage, which he also faced, shifted a little in their seats but didn’t turn around. Paul realized he’d said “America” not “Canada” and, in his state of near immunity from shame and/or anxiety, acknowledged a theoretical embarrassment, which someone not on MDMA, in his situation, might experience. For one or two seconds, with tepid disappointment toward himself, before moving nearer to the stage, Paul dimly believed people had ignored him because they knew he was on drugs and were afraid he might say more things that would humiliate and further expose himself, in a completely non-funny way, as pathetic and troubling and drug-addled and sad. After the reading, then a Q&A—during which someone asked if Paul felt like his life had changed the past few years and he said no, which he qualified by saying it had, then after a pause said he honestly felt unable to answer accurately—the owner of Drawn & Quarterly approached and thanked Paul for coming to Montreal. Paul pitched a children’s book, to be illustrated by a known graphic novelist who’d confirmed interest, based on one of his poems—when i was five i wentfishing with my familywhen i was fivei went fishing with my familymy dad caught a turtlemy mom caught a snappermy brother caught a crabi caught a whalethat night we ate crabthe next night we ate turtlethe next night we ate snapperthe next night we ate whalethe next night we ate whalethe next night we ate whalethe next night we ate whalethe next night we ate whalethe next night we ate whale—with each line on its own page and the last line repeated as many times as needed. Maybe a different artist could illustrate each page to create a sort of anthology. As a children’s book, due to the content, it would appeal to college students and teenagers and be a popular gift choice. It could become “one of those things,” said Paul, who considered, at  one point, while talking, if his behavior might be a little tactless and easily concluded it might be to “normal people” but not the owner of Drawn & Quarterly, which had published many books, among Paul’s favorites, sympathetic to socially dysfunctional characters.When Paul finished talking, the owner, who’d sustained a polite, slightly tense smile and a tired and unblinking gaze, said “thank you” and walked away.Paul’s main feeling, an hour and a half later, in a café with six to eight strangers, staring at his hands wrapped tightly around his teacup, was an excruciating combination of social anxiety and, as the MDMA stopped working, disintegrating functioning, including tremulous fingers and what felt like an inability to control or predict the volume and pitch of his voice and a helpless sensation that his face—especially if he tried to mollify its severe appearance, which he would need to do if anyone asked him a question—might begin quivering or flinching uncontrollably. His memory of what he now viewed as a “major, egregious faux pas,” his interaction with Drawn & Quarterly’s owner, was vague and nonlinear and dominated by a troubling suspicion that, with his pitch of a book in a genre Drawn & Quarterly didn’t publish, he’d interrupted the owner’s initial greeting.Hiding in the bathroom, Paul remembered that, when he processed the identity of the owner, approaching from maybe six feet away, he’d felt a sensation not unlike clicking “send” for a finished draft of a long email, setting off his children’s book pitch. He probably had referenced his poem as if it were common knowledge because he didn’t know how he could have conveyed its effect without reciting it in full. He remembered, or thought he remembered, seeing disappointment inside the owner’s eyes—a faint off-coloring, like  a woundless scar, a millimeter behind the cornea—which had seemed sad in a manner like his life (operating his publishing company, living in the same apartment for twenty years, accumulating obligations in the bleak world of graphic novels) was a pure, omnipresent, concrete reminder, Paul vaguely imagined while standing in a stall staring at his iPhone, that he was the only entity building and embellishing and imperialistically expanding his own unhappiness.Around midnight, after everyone in the café had gone to a concert, Paul was alone in the Drawn & Quarterly book-store’s manager’s apartment. He looked at Twitter for what felt like twenty minutes, alternating hands to hold his iPhone ten to fifteen inches above his face. He emailed Charles—I’m lying in bed on a sofaFeel strongly like I simply want to relate my feelings of bleakness in this emailMy legs feel cold—with “Feeling bleak” as the subject. He was looking at Twitter again, a few minutes later, when for the fifth or sixth time since getting it in August he dropped his iPhone on his face, which did not register in its expression that anything had happened until after impact. He considered emailing Charles that his iPhone fell on his face. Then he tried to do what he couldn’t specifically remember having done since college—he chose one of his favorite songs and, with a meekly earnest sympathy toward himself, listened to it on repeat at a high volume and tried to focus only on the drums, or bass guitar, until he was drowsy and decontextualized and memoryless, when he would half-unconsciously remove his  earphones and turn off the music, careful not to be noticed and assimilated by the world, and disappear into the reachable mirage of sleep.But he couldn’t focus on the music. He couldn’t ignore a feeling that he wasn’t alone—that, in the brain of the universe, where everything that happened was concurrently recorded as public and indestructible data, he was already partially with everyone else that had died. The information of his existence, the etching of which into space-time was his experience of life, was being studied by millions of entities, billions of years from now, who knew him better than he would ever know himself. They knew everything about him, even his current thoughts, in their exact vagueness, as he moved distractedly toward sleep, studying him in their equivalent of middle school “maybe,” thought some fleeting aspect of Paul’s consciousness, unaware what it was referencing.[SEND LAURA: \"when i leave this place\"] Posted by Nate at 1:17 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "L: ARRIVE IN TORONTO",
    "text": "L: ARRIVE IN TORONTO Wednesday, November 21, 2018 ARRIVE IN TORONTO Paul arrived in Toronto the next night on a Megabus, then rode two city buses to the apartment of a Type Books employee and his girlfriend and slept on a sofa. In Whole Foods the next day, for around five hours, he ate watermelon and looked at the internet and typed answers to an email interview. He walked to a café near Type Books and asked on one of the two threads on 4chan about him that, for some reason, had appeared the last two days—and, with two to four hundred posts each, 90 to 95 percent derogatory, were the two longest threads on him that he’d ever seen—if anyone in Toronto could sell him MDMA or mushrooms within two hours. Someone named Rodrigo, who’d recently moved here from San Francisco, Paul discerned via Facebook, emailed that he could get mushrooms and maybe MDMA but not until after Paul’s reading.In Type Books people stood in an encroaching half circle around a nervously grinning Paul, seated on a stool, “completely exposed,” he felt, as an employee read a long, admiring, complicated introduction that seemed like it had incorporated sections of a dissertation. Paul, appearing sometimes openly frightened, honestly answered “I don’t know” for almost every question during the Q&A, then in each ensuing silence, feeling pressure to elaborate, mumbled sentence fragments he knew were untrue or inaccurate before, in closing, reiterating “I don’t know.” Near the end, while saying “but I don’t really know,” he stuttered a little. After the reading he went to a restaurant with four Type Books employees and their friend Alethia, 22, who had published around six hundred articles since leaving college two years ago to write for Toronto’s leading alt weekly. Paul asked if Alethia, whom he felt attracted to and curious about, wanted to interview him while, as a journalistic angle, he was “on MDMA.”In Rodrigo’s apartment, a few hours later, Paul searched his name in Alethia’s email account—signed in on Rodrigo’s tiny, malformed-looking, non-MacBook laptop—while she was in the bathroom and saw she had pitched an article on him, two months ago, to the Toronto Sun, who had not responded, it seemed. Paul and Rodrigo each swallowed a capsule of MDMA. Paul said he felt “nothing” and swallowed another and, when it began taking effect, repeatedly encouraged Alethia to also ingest MDMA, “for the interview,” but she declined, citing that when she tried LSD she rode a bus around Toronto for five hours. Rodrigo lay with his girlfriend on his bed as Paul and Alethia sat on beanbags on the floor and talked for two and a half hours, during which Paul sometimes wanted to hug or kiss Alethia, whose default expression, it seemed, was “worried,” sometimes in an endearingly doe-like manner and sometimes like it was an effect of her job, as a full-time journalist, with its deadlines and copyediting, Paul thought half sarcastically more than once. Alethia  said “you were saying you’ve been doing readings on drugs because it makes you feel more comfortable” and asked why.“Um, actually, I just think it’s more fun.”“More fun for you, or the people who are there?”“In my view it’s more fun for everyone,” said Paul.“So when you did that reading a few weeks ago on mushrooms . . . you stopped after two minutes?”“Um,” said Paul. “Two minutes?”“Yeah. Is that what happened?”“What reading?”“Oh. I don’t know . . . a few weeks ago.”“The Booksmith?”“Yeah. In San Francisco.”“Oh. I was seeing ‘tribal patterns’ on the paper, because I was staring at it on mushrooms, and I felt like I was sweating, and I kept thinking ‘Hunter S. Thompson.’ Then I felt like I couldn’t go on anymore. I was preparing to say something like ‘I’m having a bad drug experience, I need to go home.’ But I looked up, at the people, and regained control.”An hour later they were discussing a recent trend of Megabus accidents, described by Paul, who was riding a Megabus to Manhattan tomorrow, as “like, twenty people dying five times in the last few days,” when Alethia asked if Paul was worried he’d be “the next to die.”“No. I don’t care if I die.”“Um,” said Alethia laughing.“I feel like I honestly don’t care if I die.”“Really? You’re not worried about dying?”“No, I think. I’m ready to die whenever.”“Because you’ve written enough books?”“No, no,” said Paul shaking his head a little. “I don’t know. I’m just ready to die. Life just seems like . . . it’s fine if I die.  Once I’m dead I’m dead.” Rodrigo from his bed said “but in an interview you talk about eating healthy and not smoking because you’ll be more productive.” Paul said health and drugs and being productive were all in service of feeling good. Alethia said she took Ritalin almost every day, from ages 8 to 12, for “attention deficit disorder.” Paul said “that seems horrible” and “that must’ve changed you.”“Yeah, I think it did,” said Alethia. “I think it did.”“People who take the most drugs by far are the kids—”“It’s so true,” said Alethia.“—who get prescribed them,” said Paul.“Who’s, like, your closest friend?”“I just felt, like . . . really alone when you said that.”“Oh no! I’m sorry.”“Wait, there has to be someone,” said Paul grinning. “I feel like I have close friends but we stop talking. Right now, I guess, what person do I feel closest to?”“Yeah,” said Alethia.“Um, I can’t remember right now. I feel close to different people over sets of days. Like if I’ve been texting someone, but then I’ll forget about them.”“Do you sometimes feel like it sucks—to just, like, live in the world?”“What do you mean?” said Paul slowly.“Like, that the world can’t provide us with enough to satisfy us.”“No,” said Paul after around ten seconds, and covered his face with his hands. “I mean . . . the world is good enough, based on evidence, because I haven’t killed myself. Like, if I killed myself . . . I could say the world is bad, on average.”“Like definitively,” said Alethia.“On average,” said Paul through his hands. “Since the urge to kill myself isn’t so strong that I actually kill myself, the world is worth living in.”• • •Alethia left around 4:30 a.m., easily declining Paul’s suggestions, bordering on “pleas,” he felt, that she stay. Rodrigo and his girlfriend seemed asleep. Sitting on a sofa, in the common room, Paul texted Alethia: “This is Paul. Good night, glad we met.” Alethia responded: “Me too. You are wonderful.” Paul lay on the sofa, bristling with wakefulness, for around forty minutes, then put his MacBook in his backpack and wrote a two-sentence note to Rodrigo and walked outside into a silvery, wintry light.On a Megabus to New York City—for around fifteen hours, due to a two-hour delay in Buffalo—he read all he could find by Alethia on the internet, becoming more “obsessed,” he felt, after each article, lying on his back across two seats with knees bent, twice dropping his iPhone onto his face. His interest in Alethia naturally decreased, the next few days, then they texted a few times and he felt renewed obsession, but he didn’t like her impersonal tone in their emails discussing their interview—which she’d spent eight hours transcribing—and, less than a week after they met, all he felt toward her, to his weak amusement, was an unexamined combination of indifference and vague resentment, which he described in an email to Charles, whose previous knowledge of Alethia was that Paul liked her “a lot,” as “strong aversion,” only half joking. Paul’s next email to Charles said “I feel like I ‘hate’ her” and that it seemed, by the bureaucratic language and curtness of Alethia’s emails, like she also “hated” him, that they “hated” each other.On Halloween afternoon, in the library, Paul read an account of his Montreal reading, when he was on two capsules of  MDMA, describing him as “charismatic, articulate, and friendly.”He read an account of his Toronto reading, when he’d been sober, describing him as “monosyllabic,” “awkward,” “stilted and unfriendly” within a disapproval of his oeuvre, itself vaguely within a disapproval of contemporary culture and, by way of a link to someone else’s essay, the internet.The next night Paul received an e-mail from Laura's mother saying Paul could stay at her house a few days while she was on a business trip so Laura wouldn’t be alone. She said they could use her car but were not allowed to go to New York City. Paul and Laura both promised not to do anything that would make her upset.

    "text": "L: GO UPSTATE Wednesday, November 21, 2018 GO UPSTATE The next day Paul rode the 8:12 a.m. train to where Laura lived in New Jersey. When he stepped off the train Laura was standing on the platform looking at him with a scared facial expression. She was wearing a new dress she had mentioned in an e-mail. The dress was light blue with white spots. “You look angry,” said Paul and they hugged. “I was very afraid and nervous, you took a while to get off the train,” said Laura. “I thought you didn’t come. I thought you were lying to me.” “No,” said Paul. “Why would I lie?” “I don’t know. I thought maybe you just wanted to get rid of me.” “But we text-messaged when I was on the train. Did you really think I would lie like that?” “I don’t know,” said Laura with a concerned facial expression. “We texted like four minutes ago,” said Paul grinning. “You look really good,” he said. “I like the dress a lot.” Laura was grinning a little. She pointed at a feature of her dress and asked Paul if he liked it. Paul said he liked it. They held hands and walked toward her house. On the steel bridge Paul looked at her face then ahead. “She is really pretty, I feel nervous to look at her face,” he thought. “Maybe that is why she never looked at my face that much. Because she was nervous. Not because she wasn’t interested.” In her room Laura said her mother wasn't home for another few hours and asked Paul if he wanted to use the bathroom. Paul said she could use the bathroom first. “Thank you for asking,” he said. “You’re welcome,” said Laura. “I want to take a shower to clean myself.” Paul hugged her and sat on her bed. There were no posters or drawings or photos on the walls. Laura returned from the bathroom and Paul pointed at something and said “I’ve never seen this. What is this?” “The head spins around,” said Laura. Paul tried to spin the head and it didn’t move. He looked at Laura. They grinned at each other. They lay on her bed and kissed. He licked her tongue. “She has bad breath a little maybe, or something, or I do, but I don’t think it is me, but that is okay,” he thought. “I feel happy. She is good now. I should be happy. I am.” Laura left the room and returned with lemons. They rubbed the lemons on each other and laughed. They licked the lemon juice and had sex. They put the used lemons in a plastic bag. “Lemon sex,” said Paul. “Lemon sex,” said Laura. In the shower she hugged him from behind. They dried each other and put on clothes. Paul said he wanted a small yellow apple. They walked to the health food store. Laura bought an organic pear. Paul bought a bag of toasted nori. Laura photographed him eating toasted nori. They walked into a residential area. Three teenage boys were sitting on a porch facing the street. “Hi,” said a teenage boy. “How are you?” “Alright,” said Laura. “How old are you?” “25,” said Laura. “Where are you from?” “Pittsburgh,” said Laura. “No, I mean, what nationality are you?” “American,” said Laura. “You look and sound German.” “I thought they were going to ‘jump’ us,” said Paul about a minute later near the steel bridge. “I felt afraid.” “Why did you think that?” said Laura. “I don’t know,” said Paul and hit Laura’s cheek with a rolled-up sheet of toasted nori. She made a sad facial expression. She laughed. Paul photographed her with his cell phone.

    "text": "L: LAURA'S MOM'S HOUSE Wednesday, November 21, 2018 LAURA'S MOM'S HOUSE Laura’s mother was home. She said something from the storage room. She came in the living room. Paul stood and shook her hand. “Hi,” he said. “Hi,” she said. They went in the living room. Paul and Laura sat on the sofa. Laura’s mother reached into her pocket and removed a bottle of what Paul recognized as 1mg Klonopin, shook it a little at Laura, then leaned against a wall and looked at them. “You couldn’t wait, could you?” she said after about ten seconds. “What day is today? It was almost two months, just a few more days, right? Two days, or something. Two more days. And I was going to let you see each other. But you just couldn’t wait.” She stared at Laura a few seconds. “And now you’re going to have to deal with the consequences.” “You wouldn’t give us a date,” said Laura. “If you had just given us a definite date when we could see each other we would have been okay with that.” Laura’s mother said Laura would have to earn back her trust over time. She asked Paul what he did in New York City. Paul said he mostly stayed in the library. He said he was a personal assistant to someone starting a jet company. She asked how Paul made money. He said he had money from his books, writing articles sometimes, and the personal assistant job. They talked about Paul’s brother's apartment on Wall Street and then Laura asked if she could go to New York City with Paul to eat dinner with a person named Ana. Laura’s mother said no and asked what they would do in New York City. “Walk around, and go in bookstores, and eat dinner,” said Paul. “And this Ana,” said Laura’s mother carefully. “She’s a writer?”  “Yes,” said Paul. “She’s in her 30s.” “I know, Laura has told me about her,” said Laura’s mother and stared at Laura blankly a few seconds then said “So all these times you’ve said you were with Beau, or whoever, you’ve been lying to me.” Laura said she only lied once. She said she really did go to New York City with Beau and Beau’s mother. Laura’s mother talked about trust then went in the kitchen and talked on the phone and began to broil something and came in the living room and asked if Paul or Laura wanted any of her potatoes. They did not. She went in the kitchen. About a minute later she put her upper body into the living room and said “I’m not as bad as Laura made me out to be, right?” Paul nodded and she returned to the kitchen. “You’re just acting this way because we have a guest,“ said Laura very loudly with an agitated facial expression. “If Paul wasn’t here you would be screaming. This isn’t how you normally are.” Paul patted Laura’s thigh and said “It’s okay” while grinning. Laura grinned and said “Sorry” in an embarrassed voice. She put American Psycho in the DVD player. About ten minutes later Laura’s brother came in the house. He looked at Laura with a neutral facial expression. He looked at the TV. He had briefly met Paul once in Laura's apartment when he slept on her sofa for a night, and they had said hi to each other and shook hands. “American Psycho,” he said. “Why are you watching this?” He went in the kitchen. Paul heard Laura’s mother say “Have you introduced yourself to Paul?” Laura’s brother came in the living room grinning and shook Paul’s hand and walked through the hallway into his room closing his door. In American Psycho a person tried to feed a cat to an ATM. The person stared at the cat with a confused facial expression. The person chased a woman through an apartment building with a chainsaw while naked. At the end of the movie it is revealed that the person had imagined his killing rampages because he was insane.

After a few minutes she put The Piano Teacher in the DVD player. They had watched it together multiple times in NYC. Laura had seen it maybe five times. It was overdue one or two years from Hollywood Video. At the end of it the main character goes to her piano recital, stands in the lobby until everyone is seated in the concert hall, takes a large knife from her music sheet case, stabs herself a few inches below her shoulder, leaves the building. Laura’s mother came in the house with Chinese food including crab rangoon. She said Paul was welcome to sightsee New Jersey with Laura as long as she knew their plans in advance. She put the crab rangoon in the freezer before taking a taxi to Newark. “What is crab rangoon?” said Paul. “Crab wrapped in cheese then fried,” said Laura. Paul and Laura went to New York City on the 5:32 p.m. train. [NYC] Posted by Nate at 1:45 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "L: NYC",
    "text": "L: NYC Wednesday, November 21, 2018 NYC Paul and Laura arrived at Penn Station around 8:20 p.m.. Laura said she wanted to get a very short haircut, a black wide-brimmed hat and a pair of sunglasses. Paul told her they could cut her hair and get sunglasses at his apartment, then go shoplifting for hats the next day. Laura said she was kidding about the haircut and wanted to find a Barnes & Noble to shoplift from. In Barnes & Noble Paul walked to different areas thinking “Where is she, she disappeared.” He saw her on the second floor. “Let’s go,” she said walking toward him. “Did you steal?” said Paul outside. Laura had stolen a Richard Yates novel and a Daniel Clowes comic. They ate dinner at Zen Palate by Union Square then stood outside on the sidewalk. Laura wanted to go to her old apartment to see if the lock had been changed. “I want to read my new comic book on my old sofa,” she said. Paul made a noise. He said he didn’t want to do that. Laura said she felt bloated and wanted to go back to Paul’s apartment. Paul looked at the cars on the street. “We are entering the next phase of our relationship,” he thought slowly while staring at the lights on the cars. “It’ll be okay probably. It’ll just be different.” An image of something was in his head and he tried to discern it but it wasn’t there anymore and they began walking toward the subway. “Can we take a taxi?” said Laura. They rode a taxi to Paul’s apartment. In the morning Paul wouldn’t leave his bed. He was lying on his back in boxer shorts. “Pull me,” he said with his eyes closed. Laura tried then said “I’m going to rape you” and sat on him and began to rape him and then they had sex. “You raped me,” said Paul. “We’re even now.” “You raped me like five times,” said Laura. “Oh yeah,” said Paul grinning.A few days ago Paul read on the internet that the age of consent was 16 in New Jersey and 17 in New York. He knew when Laura was 16 she had done things with a 26-year-old and a 28-year-old and no one had gone to jail. He knew someone who had been in jail and they did ten minutes of work a day picking up cigarette stubs. This person was not ass-raped, cut with a knife, or beaten. This person was Paul’s father and Paul knew from his mother that twice when she visited him he had leaned back in his chair and looked into the distance and said that life in jail was good. Paul would go to jail if he had to and be calm about it maybe. \"I don’t want to go to jail,” he thought. “But I don’t want to do a lot of things. My life doesn’t matter.” He and Laura wrestled a little and fell off the bed and lay on each other a few minutes then showered and stood in his room putting on clothes.“Let’s do our plan,” he said about going to Angelika Film Center, watching Lemming, walking to American Apparel, stealing dresses, eating porridge at Congee Village, going canoeing in Central Park. About fifteen minutes into Lemming a man kneeled by a bed and woke his wife and said something in French. The subtitles said “I think it’s a kind of hamster.” Paul and Laura laughed. “They should end the movie now and have the screen say ‘lemming,’” said Paul grinning at Laura in the dark. At American Apparel Laura carried eight dresses into the dressing room. The dresses were not the right size. Paul left the dressing room and returned with eight dresses of the right size. They put the eight right-sized dresses into Laura’s bag and Paul left American Apparel with the bag. Laura left the dressing room and put the eight dresses of the wrong size on the rack and left American Apparel. “They’re going to notice,” said Paul walking quickly. “It seems like they can’t not notice. Do you think they’ll send the police?” “It doesn’t matter,” said Laura. “I’m probably going back to New Jersey anyway. They’ll search for a skinny boy and a girl in a blue dress.” “Change into one of the dresses. The red one.” “Okay. I’ll change at the restaurant.” They calculated they had stolen around $250 worth of dresses. They talked about going to all the American Apparels in New York City to steal $2,000 of things a day as their job. Paul said he was jealous. “You have all those dresses,” he said. “I have nothing.” “I’ll steal you clothes later,” said Laura. “No you won’t,” said Paul. “I have nothing,” he said in a loud voice and grinned. At Congee Village Laura changed into the red dress. “You look good,” said Paul and touched her thigh and shoulder. He said he didn’t have money. He went outside to find an ATM. He walked a few minutes and found no ATM. He ran across a street into a deli and said “Do you have an ATM?” They did not. It was very sunny outside. Paul was sweating. “I don’t know,” he thought. “I should be able to find an ATM.” He walked across two streets. He saw an ATM. He entered his PIN and cash left the ATM and he calmly moved it into his pants pocket. He walked and ran to the restaurant with a neutral facial expression. Laura was eating porridge. Paul said they would need to use a taxi to get to Central Park in time for canoeing. He sat. His porridge was very warm. Laura used soy sauce. Paul used soy sauce and hot chili sauce. He drank water. “We’re not talking because I’m not talking,” he thought in the taxi looking out his window. “But I feel like I’ll say something soon. And then we’ll be okay again.” The sidewalk and store windows were sometimes shaded by trees. They were somewhere in Greenwich Village. Paul thought that if Laura left he would go to the library to calmly work on things. It was Sunday. Laura sent her mother a text saying she was in New York with Paul then put her on the phone's blocked callers list. “I feel good,” thought Paul. “My life seems good.” At Central Park they sat against a wall and photographed themselves kissing. Paul walked about thirty feet away and photographed Laura. He walked closer and photographed her again. He walked closer and photographed her again. He walked closer and hugged her.[CALVIN] Posted by Nate at 1:54 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "text": "L: CALVIN Wednesday, November 21, 2018 CALVIN Later that night Laura received a call from Calvin, her cousin in Baltimore, who she had only met three times in the past but felt like she \"connected\" with on some level, to tell her that he had just answered a call from her mother at their house—which was empty except for Calvin and his girlfriend, Maggie, due to his parents being on a two week Caribbean cruise—and was held “hostage” for more than an hour by Laura's mother's aggravated soliloquizing on Laura. Laura surprised Paul when she handed him the phone with no explanation and a suppressed grinning expression. On the phone Calvin told Paul that he followed him on the internet and was \"pretty blown away\" that Paul was in a relationship with his cousin. Calvin said that Paul and Laura would be welcome to stay with him and Maggie in Baltimore if they wanted \"somewhere to hide\" for the next week or so.  [BALTIMORE] Posted by Nate at 2:00 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "L: BALTIMORE",
    "text": "L: BALTIMORE Wednesday, November 21, 2018 BALTIMORE Calvin, 18, and Maggie, 17, were seniors in high school who’d been friends since middle school and were currently in a relationship of almost four years.The day after arriving Paul and Laura bought LSD and chocolates containing psilocybin mushrooms from a drug dealer Laura knew in college. They each ingested a little LSD and shared a chocolate containing psilocybin mushrooms and sat in sunlight in Calvin’s backyard, which had a hot tub and swimming pool and skateboard ramp and basketball hoop, “working on things” on their MacBooks. When Calvin returned from school they got in his SUV to go to Whole Foods, where Maggie was meeting them after work at American Apparel, and shared another chocolate. Calvin, who hadn’t wanted any, meekly asked if maybe he’d feel good if he ate only a small piece, seeming like he wanted to be encouraged to try.“We already ate it,” said Paul, and laughed a little, in the backseat.Laura, in the front passenger seat, was still holding a piece. Hearing Calvin she had seemed to slow its movement toward her mouth. She made a quiet, inquisitive noise and glanced slightly toward Paul, then resumed a normal speed and placed it inside her mouth. Paul lay on his back for most of the drive, sometimes sitting to noncommittally mumble something relevant, including that he liked Stereolab and Rainer Maria, to what he could hear of Calvin and Laura’s conversation. Walking toward Whole Foods, across its parking lot, Paul said he was “beginning to feel the LSD, maybe.”“Really?” said Laura. “I feel . . .”“I don’t know,” said Paul.“I can’t tell what I feel,” said Laura, and automatic doors opened and they entered the produce section, where they held and examined different coconuts. Calvin stood looking back, seeming tired and a little afraid, like a reclusive uncle supervising his unruly niece and outgoing nephew.“You should get one,” said Paul. “It’s refreshing.”“I’m . . . allergic,” said Calvin a little nervously.“Shit,” said Paul grinning. “I forgot. Again. Sorry.”The next few minutes, while Paul and Laura went to three different sections—butcher, pizza, sushi—to get their coconuts opened, Calvin remained at a far distance, randomly and inattentively picking up and looking at things and sometimes glancing at Paul and Laura with a worried, socially anxious expression. Something about Calvin, maybe a corresponding distance or that they had similar body types, reminded Paul of Michelle, the night of the magazine-release party, waiting with slack posture at a red light, before she touched his arm and leaned on the metal fence. Paul, in line to pay, considered saying the word “Kafkaesque” to describe getting their coconuts opened, but was distracted by an eerily familiar actress’s smiling face on a magazine cover and remained silent, then paid and maneuvered to a booth and sat by Laura, across from Calvin, who stared at them with wet eyes and a beseeching, insatiable, inhibited expression that alternated between Paul and Laura to keep both, Paul thought, locked into his meekly laser-like gaze. Paul held his left hand like a visor to his forehead and looked down and sometimes said “oh my god.” Whenever he glanced at Laura, who seemed to be enjoyably displaying an unceasing grin, he laughed uncontrollably and, due to the contrast with Calvin’s alienated demeanor, felt more uncomfortable. Unsure how to stop grinning, or what to do, he left the booth for straws. When he returned, after feeling mischievous and Gollum-like for two to three minutes while trying to secretly record Laura and Calvin with his iPhone, he lowered himself skillfully, he felt, in a 180-degree turn, like that of a screw, to a seated position, flinging a straw at Laura while connecting the awning of his left hand to his forehead. He moved his coconut to his lap and heard a partially metallic, imaginary-sounding noise. He stared without comprehension, but also without confusion, at Calvin’s body, which was hunched close to the table with demonically jutting shoulder blades rising and falling in rhythm to what sounded like a computer-generated squawking. The cube of space containing Calvin seemed to be reconfiguring itself, against passive resistance from the preexisting configuration of Calvin, mutating him in a process of computerization. Paul thought he was witnessing a kind of special effect, then realized Calvin was imitating a pterodactyl.“I feel so much better now,” said Calvin. “Just doing what I want . . . what I want to do . . . yeah. Before, I was holding back, so I felt bad. I feel so much better now.”“You were making pterodactyl noises,” said Paul in disbelief.Maggie appeared as a desultory object, rapidly approaching the booth in a horizontal glide, seeming unnaturally small and eerily low to the ground. “LSDs, LSDs,” she was saying in a high-pitched, taunting, witch-like voice. Paul, who was laughing and repeatedly saying “oh my god” and variations of “I can’t believe this is happening,” heard Calvin say “they’re not on LSD.” Maggie said “magic mushrooms” and seemed to be imitating an elf as she entered the booth behind Laura and Paul, who heard Laura say “we’re on LSD and mushrooms,” and briefly visualized the main character from Willow, the dwarf with magical powers. Things seemed defectively quiet, like before an explosion in a movie, the five to ten seconds before Maggie rose in the booth behind Paul, who turned and saw a faceless mound: Maggie, with her entire head inside a black beanie, saying “is this the front of me or back.”In the parking lot Maggie went alone to her car. Calvin was backing out of his parking space when Paul, leaning forward from the backseat, said he wanted to be in Maggie’s car. Calvin braked and asked what to do, alternately looking at Paul and Laura with a helpless, besieged expression. Paul looked down a little, as if to suspend an intensity of visual input, to allow his brain to better focus on the question, but he wasn’t thinking about the question, or anything, except maybe something about how he wasn’t thinking anything, or was having problems thinking.“I don’t know what to do,” said Calvin incredulously. “Should I call Maggie?”“No,” said Paul after a few seconds.“Maggie already left, I think,” said Calvin.“Let’s just go,” said Paul.“But . . . if you want to be in Maggie’s car.”“I want to be here now.”“If you . . . are you sure?”“I want to be in this car. Maggie’s car is small.”“Are you sure?”“Yes,” said Paul leaning against the front passenger seat, aware of the distant municipality of the SUV’s lighted dashboard. Things seemed darker to him than expected, a few minutes later, on the highway. The unlighted space, all around him—and, outside the SUV, the trees, sky—seemed more visible, by being blacker, or a higher resolution of blackness, almost silvery with detail, than normal, instead of what he’d sometimes and increasingly sensed, the past year, mostly in his room, since one night when, supine on his yoga mat, his eyes, while open, had felt closed, or farther back in his head, and his room had seemed “literally darker,” he’d thought, as if the bulb attached to his non-working ceiling fan had been secretly replaced, or like he was deeper inside the cave of himself than he’d been before and didn’t know why. “My face . . . it feels like it’s moving backward,” Calvin was saying in a surprised, confused voice. “It keeps floating into me . . . itself . . . repeatedly.”“Jesus,” said Paul. “Why?”“Percocet. And a little Codeine.”“I didn’t know you’ve been on those.”“I told you . . . at the house.”“Jesus,” said Paul. “I remember now.”They began talking about a Lil Wayne documentary that focused on Lil Wayne’s “drug problem,” which Lil Wayne denied. Paul felt it was bleak and depressing that the film-makers superimposed their views onto Lil Wayne. Calvin seemed to agree with the documentary. Paul tried, with Laura, who agreed with him, he felt, to convey (mostly by slowly saying variations of “no” and “I can’t think right now”) that there was no such thing as a “drug problem” or even “drugs”— unless anything anyone ever did or thought or felt was considered both a drug and a problem—in that each thought or feeling or object, seen or touched or absorbed or remembered, at whatever coordinate of space-time, would have a unique effect, which each person, at each moment of their life, could view as a problem, or not.In Calvin’s room, supine on carpet, Paul felt circumstantially immobile, like a turtle on its back, and that Calvin and Maggie were pressuring him to decide on an activity. Then he was sitting on the edge of a bed, staring at an area of carpet near his black-socked feet, vaguely aware of his inability to move or think and of people waiting for him to answer a question. He grinned after hearing himself, in his memory of three or four seconds ago, say “I don’t know what to do” very slowly, as if each word had been carefully selected, with attention to accuracy and concision. Laura silently exited Calvin’s bathroom and left the room in a manner, Paul vaguely felt, like she was smuggling herself elsewhere. Paul heard Maggie say “all right, we’re going to the hot tub” and remain in the top left corner of his vision a few seconds before vanishing. Paul walked lethargically into the bathroom, removed his clothes, stood naked in Calvin’s room struggling to insert his left leg into his boxer shorts’ left hole, which kept collapsing shut and distortedly reappearing as part of a slowly rippling infinity symbol, tottering on one leg sometimes and quietly falling once—mostly deliberately, anticipating a brief rolling sensation and a respite on the thick carpet—before succeeding and, after staring catatonically at nothing for a vague amount of time, aware of something simian about his posture and jaw, carefully going downstairs.In the backyard, a few minutes later, Paul and Laura, holding each other’s arms in an indiscernibly feigned kind of fear, hesitated before advancing, barefoot on the spiky and yielding grass, into the area of darkness Calvin and Maggie, after testing the swimming pool’s water as too cold, had gone. Paul stopped moving when he saw the disturbing statue of a Greek god wearing a gorilla mask, which Calvin, that afternoon, had said someone put on last Halloween, then abandoned Laura by running ahead, on his toes a little. As he slightly leaped, followed closely by Laura, into the hot tub, he imagined his head shooting like a yanked thing toward concrete. He surfaced after exaggeratedly, unnecessarily allowing the water to absorb his impact, then stared in disbelief at a balled-up Maggie rolling forward and back like a notorious, performing snail. “Oh my god,” he said, aware his and Laura’s feet were deliberately touching. “Look at Maggie. What is she doing?”“I was doing water sit-ups,” said Maggie.“I can’t believe . . . that,” said Paul. “Have you ever done that?”“No,” said Maggie. “What if we were all obese right now?”“The water would be displaced,” said Paul without thinking, and people laughed. Paul felt surprised he was able to cause authentic laughter at his handicapped level of functioning. The above-water parts of him were waiting patiently, he thought while staring at the soil beneath the bushes a few feet beyond the hot tub and remembering disliking the presence of soil while in swimming pools as a child in Florida, for the laughter to end and something else to begin. He became aware of himself saying “what would we be talking about right now if we were obese?” and, comprehending himself as the extemporaneous source of what seemed to be an immensely interesting question, felt a sensation of awe. He remained motionless, with eyeballs inattentively fixated on the obscure pattern of the bushes behind and to the left of Calvin and an anticipatory nervousness, as he imagined staring at each person, in turn, to confirm—or convey, depending on the person—that, despite his impaired functioning, he had, unforeseen to anyone, including himself, asked a question of nearly unbelievable insight.“We would talk about if we were skinny,” said Maggie.“No, because it would be too depressing,” said Paul, surprised again by the power of his mind but less than before, a little suspicious now of his own enthusiasm.“You’re right,” said Calvin, and seemed to look at each person in disbelief—which confused Paul because he had imagined doing that himself.“We would talk about food,” said Maggie.“I feel like people are staring at me,” said Paul.“Me too, a little,” said Laura.“I wish I could see how Laura and I are like on mushrooms now,” said Paul.“Me too,” said Laura.“I was going to bring my camera but didn’t want to get it wet,” said Maggie.“People are staring at me weird, except Laura,” said Paul. “I wish someone was recording us.”“Just ask me later and I’ll tell you,” said Maggie.“Later,” said Paul, confused. “When?”Calvin said it was time for Maggie to go home and they left seemingly instantly. Paul was aware of having waved at them and of having meekly said “bye, Maggie,” to himself, he realized, as he continued staring at where they had gone out of view—to postpone interacting with Laura, who’d been abnormally quiet most of the night, he uncertainly realized with increasing anxiety. Maggie should have stayed longer, because he and Laura were only visiting a few days, he thought earnestly for a few seconds before realizing, with only a little sheepishness, that Maggie had her own desires, separate from those of anyone else, which she expressed through her actions. Paul knew that, because he kept thinking about Maggie, his demeanor and behavior, when he finally acknowledged Laura, would appear, if not obviously feigned, to convey “I want to be elsewhere” or “I want to be doing things in service of being elsewhere,” which Laura would easily discern, if she hadn’t already. Paul moved his mouth to where water was bubbling and, partly facing away from Laura, said something about it feeling “nice.” Laura moved her mouth to a different area of similar bubbling. After ten to fifteen minutes Calvin appeared and said “you guys can come inside now, Maggie went home,” seeming to have assumed they had been waiting for his approval to go inside. Paul had begun feeling comfortable and was confused why they couldn’t—and weren’t asked if they wanted to—stay in the hot tub.After showering in separate bathrooms Paul and Laura sat on Calvin’s carpeted floor. Calvin, covered by blankets up to his underarms, with his upper body propped by pillows, seemed like he was cautiously testing an unexpected feeling of health and energy while on his “death bed.” Maggie, he said in a worried and slightly fascinated voice, had wanted to perform oral sex on him, but he hadn’t been aroused, which had upset her maybe. Laura said it was normal for sexual desire to leave sometimes. Calvin said he and Maggie hadn’t had sex in four months. Paul said that seemed normal because they’d been together three years and that Calvin’s drug use—Percocet, Codeine, Klonopin, Adderall—the past few months, based on what Laura told him, seemed high, which probably had an effect. Then they discussed what to do now, for an activity, but couldn’t decide—each person seemed committed to not deciding—and became locked into what felt like a three-way staring contest, which they mutely sustained, each person alternating between the other two, for thirty to forty seconds, until Paul bluntly said he wanted to “go for a walk with only Laura, outside,” and, after mumbling something incoherent about mushrooms—vaguely wanting to convey it was uncomfortable while on mushrooms to be around people not on mushrooms—quickly gained Laura’s assent and repeatedly positioned himself to displace, or push, her toward where he was going, until both were outside the room, in a dark hallway, where they huddled together and maneuvered grinning to winding stairs, which they descended holding hands, toward the front door.They walked down the driveway into the upper-middle-class neighborhood with their inside arms folded up and against each other. Most front yards had one or two fashionably sculpted trees and two or more colorful Boy Scouts–like patches of flowers and plants in independent organization. Paul saw, in a side yard, a pale fence with the colorless, palatially melancholy glow of unicorns and remembered how in Florida, in the second of his family’s three houses of increasing size, both his neighbors had built fences—rows of vertical, triangular-topped slats of wood that had seemed huge, medieval—around their backyards. Paul said he felt like he was in Edward Scissorhands and they sat on a concrete embankment facing the street with their feet on a sidewalk. Paul slightly looked away as he said “there’s so many stars here” without much interest.Laura pointed and asked if one was moving.“In place, maybe,” said Paul uncertainly.“It looks like it’s vibrating,” said Laura.“It’s, um, what thoughts do you have about UFOs?” said Paul looking away, as if not wanting Laura to hear him clearly. “I’m doing it . . . I’m saying stereotypical things that people say while on mushrooms.”“That’s okay. UFOs are interesting.”“I know it’s okay,” said Paul, and asked if Laura had experienced “any UFO things.” Laura said she wore purple and put glitter on her eyes every Friday in fourth grade because she thought, if she did, aliens would notice and take her away.“That seems really good,” said Paul feeling emotional. “All purple?”“No. It just had to be one thing that was purple.”“Where did you think they would take you?”“I don’t think I thought about that,” said Laura. “Just ‘away.’ Anywhere.”“What . . . did your classmates, or other people, think?”“I’ve never told anyone.”“Really? But . . . it’s been so long.”“I didn’t have anyone to tell, really.”“You haven’t told anyone except me?”“No. Let me think. No, I haven’t.”Paul had begun to vaguely feel that he already knew of a similar thing—something about purple glitter and fourth grade, maybe from a children’s book—or was he remembering what he just heard? His voice sounded bored, he thought, as he told Laura about when, as a fourth or fifth grader, he really wanted to see a UFO and was on a plane and saw a brown dot and, without any excitement or sensation of discovery, repeatedly thought to himself that he’d seen a UFO. “I think I was aware at first that I was ‘faking’ it,” said Paul uncertainly. “But . . . I think I convinced myself so hard that I made myself forget that part . . . when I was aware, and I think I really believed I saw a UFO.”“Whoa. Did you tell anyone you saw a UFO?”“I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone. I don’t think I cared if anyone knew. I was just like, ‘I saw a UFO.’ I think I was extremely bored. I was like a bored robot.”[CHESAPEAKE BAY] Posted by Nate at 2:16 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "L: CHESAPEAKE BAY",
    "text": "L: CHESAPEAKE BAY Wednesday, November 21, 2018 CHESAPEAKE BAY The next night Laura and Paul met Cristine, 22— a mutual acquaintance from the internet —and Cristine’s friend Sally, 22, in a public park that was closed for the night. Cristine sold Paul eight 36mg Ritalin and ten psilocybin chocolates, wrapped in tinfoil, like little hockey pucks. They each ate a chocolate and walked through the park, to the end of a beach, where they sat in the gently fluorescent light of a half moon that looked like a jellyfish photographed, from far below, in mid-propulsion, its short tentacles momentarily inside itself.In the distance, Baltimore’s three tallest buildings, each with a different shape and style of architecture and lighting, were spaced oddly far apart, like siblings in their thirties, in a zany sitcom. After spending their lives “hating” one another, in a small town, they moved to different cities and were happy, but then got coincidentally transferred by their employers to the same medium-size city. They were all named Frank. Paul felt reluctant to say anything weird because Cristine and Sally were behaving normally, with earnest expressions, as if pretending they weren’t on mushrooms, except sometimes one would mention seeing beautiful colors, increasing Paul’s apprehension because earlier he and Laura had bonded over feeling alienated by people who focused on visuals, instead of people, while on hallucinogens. Deciding, after around fifteen minutes to drive—Paul in his rental, Sally in her yellow Datsun—somewhere, they walked on the beach toward the parking lot. The clear moonlight sometimes fleetingly appeared, on Chesapeake Bay, to their left, as thin layers of snow, resting on the surface of the water, as if painted on, or briefly riding the shoreward, foamy fronts of tiny waves before vanishing. Sally’s car, on the highway, got a flat tire. Paul and Laura couldn’t stop grinning, due to the mushrooms, sitting on a sidewalk in downtown Baltimore, waiting for AAA, as a frowning Sally, whose car had a missing window covered by a garbage bag, persistently bemoaned her situation without looking at anyone. Cristine, grinning sometimes at Paul and Laura, drove everyone, in Paul’s car, to Johns Hopkins University, where Paul and Laura walked far behind Cristine and Sally, on a slightly uphill sidewalk. “When you said that thing about glitter and purple clothing I felt vaguely like I already knew about it,” said Paul. “You really haven’t told anyone?”“The only person I’ve told is my friend Jennika.”“You said I was the only person you’ve told.”“I know,” said Laura. “I shouldn’t have said that.”“Did you forget? Yesterday?”“No, I knew. I was nervous—I thought I was talking too much.”“But I was asking you about it.”“I thought I was boring you.”“You weren’t,” said Paul. “At all.”“I just wanted to, like, ‘move on.’ ”“Don’t do that. If I ask something I really want to know.”“I know. I don’t want to do that.”“You lied . . . to me,” said Paul, and felt dramatic and self-conscious. “Wait, let me think. I’m thinking if I were you . . . if I would lie about that. I think . . . yeah, I would, if I didn’t want to talk about it.” He would if he didn’t anticipate becoming close to the other person, or talking to them again. “I understand, I think.” He imagined Laura’s inattentive, half-hearted view of him as “vaguely, unsatisfactorily desirable,” like how he viewed most people. “I would lie, like that, in that situation. Are you sure you haven’t written it somewhere? Like on your blog maybe?”“I’m really sure. I’m ninety percent sure.”“Only ninety percent? That’s, like, ‘unsure,’ I feel.”“I’m really sure. I’m ninety-five percent sure.”“You can tell—”“Paul,” said Laura, and grasped his forearm. They stopped walking. More aware of Laura’s perspective, looking at his face ( and not knowing what expression she saw or what he wanted to express), than of his own, Paul didn’t know what to do, so went “afk,” he felt, and remained there—away from the keyboard of the screen of his face—as Laura, looking at the inanimate object of his head, said “if I did I would tell you” and, emphatically, “I’m not lying to you right now.”“Okay,” said Paul, and they continued walking.Sprinklers could be heard in the distance.“I believe you,” said Paul.“Really?”“Yeah. I haven’t not believed you. I was just saying . . . maybe you got the idea or something similar to it from somewhere else, like a children’s book we’ve both read, but we forgot about it, or something like that.”“I don’t think I did,” said Laura.“I feel like I do that a lot.”“Maybe,” said Laura quietly.Around 1:30 a.m., after Cristine and Sally had left, Paul and Laura were walking in downtown Baltimore trying to find any open restaurant when they entered a hotel through an “employees only” door and ascended on an escalator and walked through dark corridors into an auditorium-like area, encountering no people. Paul imagined the building omni-directionally expanding at a rate exceeding their maximum running speed, so that this goalless, enjoyably calm exploration of a temperature-controlled, tritely uncanny interior would replace his life, with its book tour and Gmail and, he thought after a few seconds, “food.” Would he agree to that? “Yes,” he thought “meaninglessly,” he knew, because he’d still be inside himself, the only place he’d ever be, that he could imagine, though maybe he didn’t know—not knowing seemed more likely.At a Denny’s near the airport Paul ordered a steak and minestrone soup. Laura ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and cheese sticks. They shared a 30mg Adderall and drove to the airport, listening to a ’90s station, both immediately recognizing Natalie Imbruglia’s “Torn,” whose lyrics, to a degree that Paul couldn’t stop grinning, seemed to be a near-unbroken series of borderline non sequitur clichés. Returning the rental car at the airport, Laura told Paul she had decided to stay in Baltimore with Calvin and his parents. Laura said her aunt and uncle were “cool,” and had always treated her with an indulgent sense of godparenthood, which her mother discouraged but would accede to them, as in everything, because of their money. Paul asked if Laura was sure everything would be okay and vaguely realized he had not considered at all the possibility of her staying with him in any long-term manner at his apartment in New York. Laura told Paul not to worry and said a little sheepishly that she was glad Calvin had paid for her tickets and hoped he didn’t mind now having to pick her up. Paul left eight psilocybin chocolates with Laura, who said she would bring them to his reading in Manhattan in eight weeks, if not earlier. They hugged tightly, and Paul, whose flight to JFK was in four hours, said he wished they had more time to listen to ’90s songs together and that he “had a lot of fun,” with Laura, the past few days.

    "text": "L: BOOK TOUR Wednesday, November 21, 2018 BOOK TOUR In a café in Ann Arbor around 10:30 p.m., two weeks later, Paul realized, when he remembered Laura’s existence by seeing her name in Gmail, he’d forgotten about her that entire day (over the next three weeks, whenever more than two or three days passed since they last communicated, which they did by email, every five to ten days, in a thread Laura began the day she saw him off at the airport, Paul would have a similar realization of having forgotten about her for an amount of time). Around midnight he drove his rental car to a row of fast-food restaurants near the airport and slept in a McDonald’s parking lot. When he woke, around 2:45 a.m., he bought and ate a Filet-O-Fish from the McDonald’s drive-thru. While trying to discern what, from which fast-food restaurant, to buy and eat next, he idly imagined himself for more than ten minutes as the botched clone of himself, parked outside the mansion of the scientist who the original Paul paid to clone himself and paid again to “destroy all information” regarding “[censored].” He drove across the street to a Checkers drive-thru and bought two apple pies, which he ate with little to no pleasure, almost unconsciously, while distractedly considering how once a bite of it was in his mouth, then chewed once or twice, there seemed to be no choice, at that point, but to swallow. He slept three hours, drove past McDonald’s and Arby’s, returned the rental car, rode a van as the only passenger to the airport, boarded the earliest flight to Boston where he took an almost two hour shuttle for Amherst College to give the fifth reading of his tour.Around two weeks later, in early October, he stayed for eight days in San Francisco in his own room, on the second floor of a house, which Daniel’s ex-girlfriend and ex-girlfriend’s sister shared. An employee at Twitter invited him to its headquarters, where he ate from two different buffets. Daniel’s ex-girlfriend’s sister’s boyfriend sold him MDMA and mushrooms, which he ate a medium-large dose of before his reading at the Booksmith, which was livestreamed on the internet. His publisher left him a voice mail the next afternoon, asking him to call them to discuss “some problems.” He emailed them late that night apologizing for missing their call and said he was available by email. He met someone from Facebook and ingested LSD, which she declined, before watching Dave Eggers interview Judd Apatow for almost two hours in an auditorium. On her full-size mattress, three hours after the interview, they watched a forty-minute DVD of a Rube Goldberg machine and kissed a few minutes, then Paul “fingered” her and, after seeming to orgasm, she rolled over and slept.

    "title": "L: MANHATTAN READING",
    "text": "L: MANHATTAN READING Wednesday, November 21, 2018 MANHATTAN READING The day before Paul’s Manhattan reading, around 2:30 a.m. in his room, Paul read a 2:12 a.m. email from Laura that said she’d “been using a lot of mental space to think about definitely ending a two year long, ‘on-and-off,’ semi-vague relationship and actually did tonight”—in reference to someone named Beau—and that she was aware of the insufficiency of her email, half the length of Paul’s email, from nine days ago, but wanted to say before sleeping that she was still coming, if it was “still okay,” she said, to Paul’s reading tomorrow and would bring the psilocybin chocolates Paul left with her two months ago as previously discussed.Increasingly, as his memory occupied less of his consciousness, the past four to six months, whenever Paul sensed familiarity in the beginnings of a thought or feeling he would passively focus on intuiting it in entirety, predicting its elaboration and rhetoric in the presence of logic and world-view like a ball’s trajectory and destination in the presence of gravity and weather. If he recognized the thought or feeling, and didn’t want it repeated, he’d end its formation by focusing elsewhere, like how someone searching for a lost dog on a field at night wouldn’t approach the silhouette of a tree. Paul, reading Laura’s email, was vaguely aware of himself considering that, to some degree, Laura was “using him” to make Beau—who Paul surmised via Facebook was the heroin using musician Laura once had mentioned as her ex-boyfriend—jealous, or to stay busy while Beau was doing other things maybe—that if things had worked with Beau she might not be coming tomorrow.Without full awareness of what he’d begun to think Paul deliberately stopped thinking and texted: “Yes. Would like if you come, see you tomorrow hopefully.” He called his publisher at 3:04 a.m., leaving a voice mail saying he understood what they probably wanted to say, that he was sorry and wouldn’t do it again—vaguely he remembered that they had, at some point, told him they disapproved of him using mushrooms at a reading—and was available by email, then slept.Paul was in Bobst Library around 3:30 p.m. and had just ingested a capsule of MDMA when Laura texted that she was around fifty minutes away. Paul walked ten blocks to the bookstore and sat on a tiny bench in the fiction section and tweeted and looked at his Gmail account. Laura texted she was in the store and had eaten a chocolate. Paul was surprised she was with a male friend, whom she introduced as a former coworker named Gary, who lived in Brooklyn.“He’s gay,” said Laura, and gave Paul a chocolate, which he chewed into a gluey paste and swallowed with lemon water from the bookstore’s café. After the reading Paul, Laura, and Gary walked to a bar for someone’s 33rd birthday. Gary left after around ten minutes and Laura said he had whispered in her ear that he felt sad and wanted to talk. “I told him I couldn’t now, I’m on mushrooms,” said Laura. “Then he asked me for mushrooms. I said I didn’t have any and he probably shouldn’t have them now anyway and I’d call him tomorrow.”Around three hours later Paul and Laura were stomach-down on Paul’s mattress watching YouTube videos of people answering the same questions sober and on hallucinogens. Paul, who kept clicking new videos, was amused by how he seemed to be comfortably and energetically, with only a little self-consciousness, “having fun,” he kept thinking, in contrast to Laura, who seemed shy in a tired, depressed, distracted manner indicating to Paul that she was maybe thinking about someone else, probably Beau, whom she would probably rather be with, at the moment, instead of Paul, who felt intrigued—and further amused—why he was not affected by this information, which normally would make it impossible for him to enjoy anything. They slept without touching, woke in the afternoon, took a taxi to Greenwich Village, where they separately “worked on things” (Paul in the library, Laura in a Starbucks) until 9:30 p.m., when they ate chocolates and watched a Woody Allen movie, which ended after midnight, on October 15, Laura’s 29th birthday. Paul said he wanted to buy her an expensive dinner and they went in an Italian restaurant that seemed moderately expensive, sat in a corner booth, ordered medium-rare steaks and a shrimp appetizer. Laura asked if she should answer a call from Beau, who’d been calling and texting all night, she said.“If you want, yeah,” said Paul looking down a little.Laura spoke to Beau in a jarringly, briefly absurdly different voice—one of impatient, dominating aggression—than Paul (who recognized the voice as similar to how he spoke, as a child, to his mother) had ever heard her use and which increased his interest in her, knowing she was capable of what to Paul was her opposite. After around fifty seconds, at a moment when she had the opportunity, Paul felt, based on hearing her side of what sounded like a mutual voicing of vague aggravation, to tactfully end the call and unambiguously convey she viewed their relationship as finished, Laura instead prolonged the call by speaking angrily, with sudden emotion indicating she wasn’t indifferent. Paul felt dizzy with the realization, as Laura continued talking in a manner like she’d forgotten his presence, that his view of her was uncontrollably changing, that parts of him were earnestly, if dramatically, no longer viewing her as a romantic possibility. He intuited a hidden intimacy in Laura and Beau’s hostility, a psychic collaboration—unconscious, or maybe conscious for one of them—assembling the structures, located days or weeks from now, where they would meet again to apologize and forgive and, while rescinding their insults, encouraged by the grammar and syntax and psychology of contrasts, near-automatically convey adoration, gratitude, compliments. Was this how people sustained relationships and sanity? By uninhibitedly expressing resentment to unconsciously contrast an amount of future indifference into affection? With quickly metabolized disappointment and a brief, vague, almost feigned restructuring of the mirage-like pile of miscellaneous items of his life Paul acclimated himself to this new reality, in which he would talk to Laura less and never with full attention, always distracted by, if not someone else, the ever-present silhouette of a possible someone else. Laura somewhat abruptly ended the call and asked if it had been entertaining, or interesting, or at least not too boring.“I was really interested.”“It was okay? Not boring?”“No. I felt high levels of interest.”“Oh,” said Laura. “Good.”“I was surprised. You sounded angry.”“Yeah,” said Laura. “I was angry.”“There was one part . . . when you started fighting more, instead of stopping, I felt, like, afraid,” said Paul, and Laura said she knew what part he was referencing and that she had specifically considered if he would be entertained, or not, and had felt uncertain. As a waiter served their medium-rare steaks and, on multicolored rice, cooked into fetal positions, eight medium-large shrimp, Paul realized with some confusion that he might have overreacted. Staring at the herbed butter, flecked and large as a soap sample, on his steak, he was unsure what, if he had overreacted, had been the cause. It occurred to him that, in the past, in college, he would have later analyzed this, in bed, with eyes closed, studying the chronology of images—memories, he’d realized at some point, were images, which one could crudely arrange into slideshows or, with effort, sort of GIFs, maybe—but now, unless he wrote about it, storing the information where his brain couldn’t erase it, place it behind a toll, or inadvertently scramble its organization, or change it gradually, by increments smaller than he could discern, without his knowledge, so it became both lost and unrecognizable, he probably wouldn’t remember most of this in a few days and, after weeks or months, he wouldn’t know it had been forgotten, like a barn seen from inside a moving train that is later torn down, its wood carried elsewhere on trucks.Laura was flying to the College of Coastal Georgia—where her aunt had studied anthropology—in the morning to see if she might want to enroll there next year and stay five to ten days as a kind of vacation. They confirmed to meet in Baltimore in three weeks, at the third last reading of Paul’s book tour, to film themselves answering questions, on mushrooms and while sober, to edit into videos like they’d seen on YouTube.

    "title": "L: VACATION",
    "text": "L: VACATION Wednesday, November 21, 2018 VACATION Their last night in Baltimore, around midnight, when Calvin and his parents were asleep, Paul and Laura decided to drink coffee and share a 30mg Adderall and each eat a psilocybin chocolate and, in the five hours before Laura would drive Paul to the airport, film part one of Mushrooms in the mansion’s basement, which included a room with guitars and amps and a drum set, a game room with four arcade machines, a one-room gym, a billiards table, a home theater, a kitchen. They kissed for twenty minutes in the gym, then shut themselves in a room with two desktop computers and had sex for an hour in the dark, then showered together. They sat on a one-seat sofa in the living room with Laura’s MacBook on their lap. Paul asked if Laura wanted to go with him next week to North Carolina and Louisiana, where he had readings at colleges.“Yeah,” said Laura.“Are you sure?”“Yeah,” said Laura.“You’ve said yes to other things you didn’t want to do.”“Can you give me an example of one of those things?”“Smoking weed with Calvin,” said Paul about two nights ago, and extended a finger, then another finger. “Inviting Patrick to visit you,” he said about someone Laura met at the College of Coastal Georgia and had spoken to twice on Skype and exchanged mix CDs and who, by Laura’s invitation, had purchased plane tickets to visit her—for six days, in two weeks—but whose Facebook messages Laura had been ignoring. Paul closed his eyes and thought about how Laura seemed like she didn’t want to talk to Beau anymore, but continued texting him and answering his calls.“Just those two things,” said Paul, and opened his eyes.“I can explain those two things. Smoking weed with Calvin, I thought it could be a thing that I want to do, but in the moment I didn’t feel like doing. And Patrick . . . I felt, like, bored for a long time . . . with romantic prospects. It seemed exciting that this person in Georgia was interested in me. I thought ‘this could at least be something to do.’ So . . . that’s why. And I thought that maybe once he came it could be fun, or something.”“So, if it’s just something to do, you’ll still do it.”“Yeah,” said Laura with the word extended. “But that’s not what it would be like . . . with you. This,” she said, and placed a hand on Paul’s shoulder. “Interests me. A lot.”“But do I interest you enough for you to go through with it,” mumbled Paul.“With what?” said Laura after a few seconds.“To go through with it,” said Paul, unsure what he was referencing.“What? What does?”“I don’t know,” said Paul quickly. “Never mind. You want to come.”“I want to come.”“Okay,” said Paul. “Good.” They saw in Google Calendar that Laura was scheduled to work—her part-time job she got the previous week at a bookstore downtown—two days next week. “So . . . you’re not going with me?”“I want to,” said Laura.“But you have work.”“I’d rather go with you than work,” said Laura noncommittally.“Then . . . what are you going to do?”“I think I can get someone to cover my shifts. They don’t really need me there anyway.”“What . . . are you doing?” said Paul, and grinned. “What the hell are you doing?”“I’m going with you,” said Laura grinning, and patted his shoulder. “I’m going with you.” [END OF THE TOUR] Posted by Nate at 3:03 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "L: END OF THE TOUR",
    "text": "L: END OF THE TOUR Wednesday, November 21, 2018 END OF THE TOUR In North Carolina two Duke University students drove Paul and Laura from the airport, where they’d arrived on separate flights, to a hotel, returning at night to drive them to the reading. Paul and Laura talked calmly in the dark backseat, holding half-full cups of hot tea from the hotel lobby, as a college radio station played something fuzzy and instrumental and wistful. Laura said she emailed Patrick last night, while she was in Baltimore and Paul was in Brooklyn, that she started liking someone else and was sorry if he felt bad and would help pay for his plane ticket. Paul asked if Patrick might still visit Baltimore, as a kind of vacation.“Probably not. He was going to stay in the mansion.”“What did Beau say last night?”“He just really wanted to hang out,” said Laura, who had mentioned in an email that she had “screamed” at Beau on the phone. “And I was like, ‘I don’t, really. I have other things to do and you shouldn’t be here.’ ”“He came over?”“No, he was like ‘fuck that, I’m coming over now.’ Or like ‘I’m driving now.’ I was like ‘this is . . . scary,’ ” said Laura, and laughed.“Jesus. What did you scream at him?”“I screamed, like, ‘this is done.’ And I hung up on him.”“Did he call more after that?”“No. He sent me . . . a mean text, insulting me. He was like, ‘you’re really great, but I’ve always thought your body sucked,’ or something.”“Seems like a non sequitur.”“I know,” said Laura, and laughed. “It was weird.”“Did you respond to that?”“No,” said Laura. “He’s insane.”“Do you think you’ll talk to him again?”Laura said “probably not.” The aquarium, sparsely forested darkness outside the car, on a street sometimes half-bracketed by shopping plazas, reminded Paul of traveling at night in Florida in his family’s minivan. During longer drives he would lay alone, with a blanket and pillow, behind the third row of seats, beyond range of communication—not obligated to respond, he felt, even if he heard his name. In the dark and padded space, on his back, he’d see everything outside, reflected toward him, as one image—squiggling, watery, elemental, synthetic, holographic, layered—in fluid, representational reconfiguration of itself. Until 13 or 14, then sometimes habitually, he never sat in the front seat of cars, even if no one else was, except the five to ten times his brother, home a few weeks or months from college, would say “I’m not your chauffeur” and force Paul, who would feel immature and embarrassed, to sit in front. “I email with Michelle like once every three months,” said Paul. “But in a manner like we’re emailing every day. Like, if someone read our emails it would seem like we were emailing every day.”“That seems good,” said Laura smiling.In Louisiana, two days later, Paul and Laura were in a Best Buy, early in the afternoon, to buy an external hard drive, because their MacBooks from storing their movies were almost out of memory. Paul was walking aimlessly through the store with a bored expression, holding the Smashing Pumpkins’ double CD below him, at waist level, where he scratched its plastic wrapping in an idle, distracted, privately frustrated manner. After finally tearing it off and lodging it, with difficulty, because it kept clinging to him by static electricity, behind some Beck CDs, he used “brute force,” he thought instructionally, to pry open the locked case and get only the blue CD, which had “Tonight, Tonight” and “Zero” on it, to listen to in the rental car.In Best Buy’s security room, which was module-like and dimmer than the store, the sheriff of Baton Rouge shook his head in strong, earnest, remarkably unjaded disappointment when Paul, asked why he was here—he had a Florida driver’s license, a New York address—said a college had invited him to speak to them, as an author.“I felt ashamed,” said Paul in the parking lot to Laura. “I feel like I was on shoplifting autopilot. I wasn’t thinking anything. I was just already doing it.” In Barnes & Noble, a few hours later, he stole Nirvana’s second “greatest hits” collection. They ate watermelon and pineapple chunks in Whole Foods, then drove downtown and rode an elevator to the sixth floor of a darkly tinted building, where Paul read to LSU’s graduate writing program for around twenty minutes (“from a memoir-in-progress that’ll be more than a thousand pages,” he said half earnestly) about a night he watched Robin Hood with Daniel at the Union Square theater, then went to a pizza restaurant, where Fran, who had whiskey in a Dr Pepper bottle, got drunker than Paul had ever seen her and the next day quit her job, after two days, as a waitress in a Polish restaurant. Paul felt self-conscious whenever mentioning a drug, in part because none of his previous books had drugs—except caffeine, alcohol, Tylenol Cold, St. John’s wort—but the audience laughed almost every time a drug was mentioned, seeming delighted, like most of them were on drugs, which was probably true, Paul thought while reading off his MacBook screen. He imagined stopping what he was reading to instead say “Klonopin,” wait three seconds, say “Xanax,” wait three seconds, etc. He didn’t notice until the word “concealment” that he was reading a sentence from something else he’d been working on that had been pasted apparently into the wrong file. He continued reading the sentence—The transparency and total effort, with none spent on explanation or concealment or experimentation, of what the universe desired—to hug itself as carefully, as violently and patiently, as had been exactly decided upon, at some point, with gravity—was [something].—until getting to “[something],” which he remembered using as a placeholder after trying combinations of synonyms for “affecting” and “confusing” and longer descriptions like “an actualized ideal, inside of which any combination of parts could never independently attain.” He stared at “[something]” and thought about saying “Klonopin” or “Xanax.” He thought about explaining the bracket usage. “The sentence I just read wasn’t supposed to be there,” he said. “I pasted it there by accident, I think. I’ll stop here, thank you.”He sat next to Laura in the front row, then Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, a woman in her 60s, whose introduction included that she was married to Richard Tuttle—the artist Gabby said Daniel resembled—read poems for thirty minutes.

    "title": "L: DRIVE",
    "text": "L: DRIVE Wednesday, November 21, 2018 DRIVE After ingesting their remaining Xanax, and more condensed coffee, they decided to drive to New Orleans, an hour away, because their flight to New York, from Baton Rouge, wasn’t until the next morning. It became dark suddenly, it seemed, during the drive. Laura expressed concern about Paul’s driving speed in residential-seeming areas. Paul encouraged her to nap (they’d both said they were sleepy, due to Xanax) and said he would be careful and, a vague amount of time later, became aware of a car that was parked, for some reason, on the street. After a few seconds of vague, unexamined confusion Paul realized the car, in the near distance, was stopped at a red light and abruptly braked hard, then harder, curling his toes with a sensation of clenching a fist. The screeching noise and forward thrust startled Laura awake, but she remained silent, seeming mostly confused. Paul drove sheepishly into a shopping plaza and parked near the middle of the mostly empty parking lot and turned off the car.“I started feeling anxious before like where were we going and we were going fast and it was dark and you were running into things a little bit and I was scared and anxious and afraid,” said Laura in one breath of wildly fluctuating volume and inflection and affect that seemed out of control and arbitrary, then in retrospect like she’d virtuosically sung a popular melody faster than anyone had ever considered trying.“Sorry,” said Paul with a worried expression.“And I felt scared,” said Laura with a slight tremble.“Sorry,” said Paul. “I’m really sorry.” After he apologized more times they walked holding hands across the parking lot. Laura said she only felt slightly interrupted when she woke, that she had been like, “wait, I don’t care, right now, about dying, but in the future I might not want to die.” In a confused, intrigued voice Paul said “in . . . the future?”“In the future I’ll—” said Laura.“But if you’re dead you’ll be dead,” said Paul in a loud, murmurred, strangely incredulous voice that he felt aversion toward and confused by.“What?”“But if you’re dead you’ll die,” mumbled Paul in a quieter, slurred voice like a stroke victim.“But I didn’t really want to die right then,” said Laura.Around midnight, on the drive back to Baton Rouge, Laura said her father had seemed to enjoy giving her Xanax and Adderall and that her mother used to get angry at him for smoking marijuana every night because it affected his memory and he would repeat himself—and, if stopped, would become defensive, argumentative—but now she didn’t try to change him anymore. Paul said his father’s default name for him, what he’d unconsciously say to get Paul’s attention or to reference Paul in conversation, was “baby” until high school, or maybe college, when it became “old baby”—in Taiwanese, where both words were one syllable—which was what he now called almost all people and animals, including Dudu, the toy poodle that his parents had bought sometime in the past year. Paul and Laura were walking near Bobst Library, a week and a half later, on a significantly colder night, in a sleet-like drizzle, when one of them said they wished it were warm and the other said they should fly somewhere warm. Las Vegas was the first suggestion. Paul said he wanted to lose all his money—around $1,200—while “peaking on MDMA” after eating at a buffet and relaxing in a hot tub.In Think Coffee, an hour later, using Laura’s MacBook, they bought a package deal for two round-trip flights and a rental car and four nights at the Tropicana, leaving on November 26, in five days.

    "title": "L: MARRY",
    "text": "L: MARRY Wednesday, November 21, 2018 MARRY “This is what the universe created, after whatever billion years,” said Paul gesturing at MGM Grand and Excalibur and Luxor, around 9:30 p.m., on a walkway above the main street of casinos in Las Vegas, which was as cold or colder than New York City, they’d learned, with some amusement, upon arriving four hours ago.“This is what we came into,” said Laura.“Look, beautiful,” said Paul earnestly about the hundreds of red lights on the backs of cars, passing beneath the walk-way, into the distance, like rubies in a mining operation.“Whoa. Pretty.”“Life sometimes offers beautiful images,” said Paul in a voice like he was in fifth grade reading a textbook aloud.“But they’re fleeting.”“Yeah,” said Paul grinning.“And you can’t do anything with them—”“Yeah,” said Paul.“—except look at them,” said Laura.“Maybe we should get drunk,” said Paul, and they entered the casino at the end of the walkway, and Laura went to the bathroom. Paul sat at a slot machine and lost $20, then stared at two middle-aged men wearing backward caps, holding full glasses of golden beer, as they approached and passed with determined, unhappy expressions. When Laura returned, a few minutes later, she said “I think I feel depleted.”“What do you mean?”“I feel kind of tired, depleted.”“But you shouldn’t even have started feeling it yet.”“Huh?” said Laura. “We had MDMA like twenty minutes ago.”Laura laughed. “I forgot.”“Jesus. You scared me.”“Sorry,” said Laura grinning, and they sat on the floor of a carpeted hallway—darkly lit from an unseen source that cyclically pulsed from a near-ultraviolet purple to dark red—positioning Laura’s MacBook to record themselves talking about their relationship.“You go,” said Paul smiling widely. “You go first.”“Okay, um, well I felt like I first really really liked you when I left you at the airport,” said Laura quickly, with a stricken expression, as if confessing something intensely shameful.“At the airport? After Denny’s?”“Yeah,” said Laura. “I wanted you to stay then.”“I thought you were hugging me really hard.”“Uh, I thought you were hugging me hard,” said Laura seeming frightened, then for around five seconds didn’t breathe. Paul laughed, in confusion. Laura said she felt a little nervous. Paul asked if she thought they were going to have sex, when they kissed, on his bed and she’d said her nose was stuffy. Laura said no, that she just kept thinking things like “what’s happening?” and “are we really going to do it?” Paul said he thought yes, because they wouldn’t have been able to stop, except by finishing, because neither of them had said no to anything yet.“We still haven’t,” said Paul. “Right?”“Um,” said Laura. “Yeah, I think.”“There was a period of like three days when I was really obsessed with you. But you weren’t responding to my email and I kind of lost the obsessive nature.”“Whoa,” said Laura. “When?”“After one of the first times we hung out. We were sending picture messages, then you stopped and didn’t email and I felt really depressed.”“Damn. Sorry. I didn’t know.”“What was going on then?”“I was kind of seeing Beau still then,” said Laura, and as the MDMA took effect Paul began using “the voice” sometimes, including when Laura asked him which of his previous girlfriends he felt closest to and he said “I’m not really sure” in an extreme parody of a stereotypical romantic comedy, and they laughed for maybe ten seconds. Paul had stopped using “the voice,” an hour later, when, during a silence, Laura asked what he was thinking and he said he was thinking why she hadn’t read or mentioned the first-person account of his life from April to July he had emailed her a few weeks ago, at her request, which had, to some degree, been obligatory, he knew. Laura said she felt strange reading about Paul’s romantic interest in other people while she was in a relationship with him. “Like, I felt jealous,” she said. “Of the Alethia person, reading about her.”“That makes sense,” said Paul earnestly.“I also felt a little strange reading about your friendship with Daniel. I was like ‘whoa, they could hang out a lot, then just not anymore; damn, what if that happens with me?’ ”“Daniel was really interested in how Kyle and I just stopped talking,” said Paul.“Then you and Daniel stopped talking.”“You don’t feel fine with that?”“I do . . . I feel fine with that. I just think of all possible situations going into something . . . positive or negative. Does that make sense?”“Yeah,” said Paul nodding. “When I first met Michelle I was telling her that I’ve had a lot of friends who I’ve just stopped talking to, and she said she was afraid I would do that to her.”“That seems to be what happens with people.”“You don’t have to read it at all,” said Paul.“Okay,” said Laura.“I trust whatever reasons you have . . . for doing anything,” said Paul, and wondered if he had felt this before, or if he already no longer felt it.The next night, after buying watermelon and salad ingredients from Whole Foods, they couldn’t find a parking spot at the Tropicana, then found one in a different area and walked a different route toward their room. Paul noticed a MARRIAGE CHAPEL sign at the end of the hallway and, after a few seconds, as they approached it silently, said “we should get married.”“I was going to say that,” said Laura.“I would get married to you.”“Me too,” said Laura. “To you.”“Let’s get married.”“Let’s do it tomorrow.”“Okay,” said Laura. “I’m confirmed.”In Whole Foods, the next afternoon, Laura emailed her manager at the used bookstore that she was quitting her job, then scrolled through photos of Elvis standing between grinning, newlywed couples. Elvis appeared more energetic and alive than the couples in almost every photo, including one in which the couple was partially blocked from view by an over-eager Elvis who seemed to have lunged toward the camera, displaying the knuckles side of a peace sign.“I don’t get it, at all,” said Paul.“It’s what people do. This is what people want.”“It really seems insane,” said Paul.“People are insane,” said Laura.“We should get an Elvis wedding.”“I’m fine with an Elvis wedding.”“Actually, I don’t want an Elvis wedding,” said Paul. “It seems extremely stressful.” Laura made a next-day reservation for a “desk wedding.” They discussed if they wanted to be on MDMA during their marriage ceremony. Laura said they should save it for the day after tomorrow, their last in Las Vegas.“We might be dead by then,” said Paul.“They won’t let us get married if we’re on drugs,” said Laura.“They’ll think we’re on drugs if we’re not on drugs. We’re normal when we’re on drugs.”Laura laughed weakly.“We’ll just—” said Paul. “We’ll figure it out.”“We’re going to be driving after the wedding, let’s just do it after we drive,” said Laura a few minutes later in a slightly pleading tone.“Okay, okay,” said Paul earnestly while nodding and patting her shoulder, then hugged her briefly.Across the street from the marriage license office was a billboard that said MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE about used cars and used car parts. In the office, which was bright and quiet and arranged like a post office, while filling out forms, Paul said getting married was like getting a tattoo, in that he just wanted to pay money and receive a service, not make appointments and go places and talk to strangers and be asked to confirm his choice. Laura said she was thinking that also and had been “having the same feeling” as before she got tattoos. Paul noticed a sign that said intoxicated applicants would be TURNED AWAY and focused, as they approached the window, on appearing normal, but realized he didn’t know how.“Look at the helpers,” he said pointing at six to ten clips, each clasping an impressive seeming amount of paper, magnetized to the side of a cabinet. “I want one.”“Me too,” said Laura grinning. “Which one do you want?”“Any of them,” said Paul after a few seconds.“I want the curvy one,” said Laura.Paul stared at the identical, brown clips.“The guy with the stripes,” said Laura. “My own ‘underling.’ ”“I’m talking about the plastic paper holder things,” said Paul.• • •Walking to their rental car they saw a shiny building and an abandoned building side by side, in the near distance. Paul expressed amazement at this second, also obvious, though maybe less egregious metaphor—the first being the used car billboard—and said their marriage would resemble the abandoned building in five years. After a pause, which functioned unintentionally for comic effect, he said “or, like, five days.”Laura laughed. “Five months, maybe,” she said earnestly.“Yeah,” said Paul thinking that of the fives—hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades—months was, by far, most likely. “We’ll be that tree,” he said pointing at a tree that appeared healthy and, he thought, dignified.“The apartments for rent,” said Laura.“The tree,” said Paul.“Yeah, the tree.”“The tree seems good.”“Nature. Natural.”“Jesus, look,” said Paul pointing at an eerie building far in the distance, thin and black, like a cursor on the screen of a computer that had become unresponsive. He imagined building-size letters suddenly appearing, left to right, in a rush—wpkjgijfhtetiukgcnlm—across the desert.The marriage chapel was less than a mile away in a building containing four to six businesses. Paul sat on a two-seat sofa, in a sort of hallway, while Laura used the bathroom. Around ten people, mostly children, surrounding what appeared to be a newlywed couple, passed through Paul’s vision, on their way out of the building, then Laura sat by him, then the pastor (a large man with white hair and a serious but friendly demeanor) sat behind a tiny desk (six feet away, at the opposite wall) and read a prepared statement, completing the  marriage, at which point—coincidentally, it seemed—a door opened and a smiling woman, with a tiny dog at her feet, congratulated Paul and Laura, after which, sort of huddled against each other, they moved toward the exit grinning.“I immediately thought ‘fuck you’ to the stranger congratulating us,” said Paul outside, on a sidewalk. Laura laughed and said she thought “pop-up ad,” because “it went through the door,” and they hugged and jumped repeatedly as one mass, spinning a little and sometimes saying “we did it” quietly. Paul ran suddenly away, onto the parking lot, in a wide arc that curved eventually toward the rental car in a centripetal force, accelerating to a speed that was, at this point in his life, unfamiliarly fast, but not near maximum, before slowing, as he neared the passenger door—and, knowing he would not collide with the car, briefly aware of the dream-like amount of control he had over his body—to a stop.

    "title": "L: 2012",
    "text": "L: 2012 Wednesday, November 21, 2018 2012 Paul was in Bobst Library’s first basement floor, seated at a computer, becoming increasingly, “neurotically,” he knew, fixated on his aversion toward Laura’s red backpack, on the possibility that she would have it with her when he went upstairs, in fifteen minutes, to meet her and that, in its presence, he would feel upset. He hadn’t seen her in three weeks, since a few days after returning from Taiwan, when she returned to New Jersey, where a drunk driver had repeatedly rammed her mother’s car, breaking her mother’s hip and badly injuring Laura’s face, which the hospital had said would heal, without scarring, in four months. Laura was wearing large, black-rimmed glasses—to block her face, she said, and they hugged.“Sorry,” said Laura with a blank expression.“About what?” said Paul, aware he’d felt only self-conscious when he noticed the red backpack, in his vision like a dot on a screen during an optometrist’s exam.“Face,” said Laura. “My face.”“You look good, don’t worry.”They walked holding hands toward Union Square, ten blocks north. Paul sometimes looked away, so Laura wouldn’t see his depressed expression. He’d begun to worry, some days, for hours at a time, that he was permanently losing interest in Laura, despite earnestly wanting, he felt, the opposite, if that were possible. “You have the red backpack,” he said grinning slightly, with some confusion.“I do,” said Laura in a tired voice.Paul sustained his grin tensely.“What do you feel about that?”“I don’t know,” said Paul looking away.“I know you don’t like it.”“It’s . . . just,” said Paul.“I’ll buy a new one tomorrow.”“No,” said Paul quietly.“I have a gift card.”“I thought your mom was buying you one for Christmas.”“So did I,” said Laura.On his mattress, on their sides, holding Laura from behind, Paul thought he wouldn’t end the relationship now, or at any time while Laura’s face, which after two and a half weeks looked like it had been recently stung by eight to twelve bees, was still healing, even if he knew he wanted to, which he didn’t.But he wouldn’t not end the relationship now, if he knew he wanted to, because it would be pitying and misleading, which Laura wouldn’t want, based on what he knew, but maybe she wouldn’t care, if she didn’t know, which she wouldn’t. Paul thought that he would stop thinking about himself and focus on Laura, but instead, almost reflexively, as a method of therapy, began thinking about suicide, then became aware of himself, a few minutes later, earnestly considering—or maybe only imagining—trying to convince Laura that they should commit suicide together. After an initial, default “open-mindedness” they could easily become fixated, then would want to do it quickly, while it made sense. They would find information on the internet and hurry to a subway station, or wherever, collaborating intimately again, looking out at the world from a new and shared perspective. Paul began to feel, in a way he hadn’t before, like he comprehended double suicide—the free and mysterious activity of it, like a roller coaster descending only into darkness, but accessible from anywhere, on the theme park of Earth, always open.He sensed his vicinity to a worldview—or a temporary configuration of preferences, two or three ideas introduced to a mood—in which double suicide would be as difficult, as illogical, to resist as a new sushi restaurant to a couple that likes sushi and trying new restaurants. He felt scared, and to distance himself from what he might accidentally engage in, or be absorbed by, in a moment of inattention or daydreaming, he opened his eyes and leveraged himself and looked over Laura’s shoulder with an extremely troubled expression. To his surprise—and self-consciously private confusion, relocated immediately away from the front of the face, to study later—she looked serene and was smiling a little, it seemed.• • •Three weeks later they were seated in Sunshine Cinema—at a showing of Somewhere that would begin in five minutes—and had ingested Xanax, which hadn’t taken effect, when Paul, staring at the screen, said in a monotone that he wanted to talk about their relationship. Immediately, in a sort of rush, which indicated to Paul that she wished she had said it first, an otherwise unfazed Laura said she also wanted to talk about their relationship. Paul said he felt bad about it, but didn’t know what to do, or what else to say. Laura said she felt the same. They talked, staring at the screen, during previews—mostly reiterating that they felt bad, didn’t know what to do, didn’t know what else to say—and stopped, when the movie began, without resolution.At some point, the past two or three weeks, Paul had begun to imaginarily hear Laura quietly sobbing—whenever she was in a bathroom with the sink on, and sometimes when in bed, beside him—in a manner as if earnestly trying to suppress uncontrollable crying, not like she was crying for attention, or allowing herself to cry. He would concentrate on discerning if the crying was real, and would become convinced, to a large degree, every time, that it was, despite learning, every time—seeing, to his consistent surprise, a friendly expression mostly—that it was not.Paul became aware of himself staring, “transfixed,” at the center of the screen, with increasing intensity and no thoughts. He focused on resisting whatever force was preventing him from moving his head or neck or eyeballs until finally—suddenly, it seemed—he calmly turned his head a little and asked if Laura was bored.“I don’t know. Are you?”“I can’t tell,” said Paul. “Are you?”“Maybe a little. Do you want to go?”“Yeah,” said Paul, and slowly stood.• • •On the L train Paul held Laura in a way that her head and upper body were on his lap, but her legs remained as if she were sitting upright, aware he was doing this—was holding her head to his lap—to mitigate pressures to talk to, or look at, each other. Laura sat up, at some point, and Paul began to speak, in vague continuation of their conversation before the movie, slowly and mostly incomprehensibly, unsure what he was trying to say. Gradually, by focusing on what he’d already said, in the past ten to twenty seconds, he learned that he seemed to be trying to convey that both he and Laura were depressed, which he realized they both already knew. He only felt motivated to say anything at all because he was on Xanax, he knew, and remembered he had Ambien in his pocket and shared one, then another, with Laura, who had sat up, then became aware of himself trying to passive-aggressively convey something by directly saying he wanted to feel pressured to concurrently be a depressed writer and fashion model.“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Laura.“I just feel . . . depressed,” said Paul, and weakly grinned.“Is there anything I can do to make you feel less depressed?”“I don’t think so,” said Paul. “You’re depressed.”“What can I do, at this point, to help our relationship?”“I don’t know,” said Paul feeling that he was more expressing himself than answering a question, and they got off the train.“Anything at all,” said Laura in a hollow voice.“I don’t want to tell anyone what to do,” said Paul staring ahead.“You wouldn’t be. You’d just be answering my question.”• • •In Sel De Mer, a seafood restaurant four blocks from Paul’s apartment, seated at the bar, Laura asked if Paul wanted more Xanax and he said “shouldn’t we not ‘go overboard’?”“What do you mean?”“We had Ambien and Xanax.”Laura appeared unresponsive.“Never mind,” said Paul. “Yes. I want more.” After sharing 2mg Xanax, then ordering, he absently ate all the free bread and butter, and they sat staring ahead, not speaking or moving, until Laura said she felt weird.“Me too. I don’t know what to say.”“Let’s just stop fighting,” said Laura.“Okay,” said Paul.“Okay,” said Laura after a few seconds.“Do you want more Xanax? I don’t feel that much.”“Yeah,” said Laura, and they shared 2mg Xanax.When Paul’s salad and clam chowder arrived he moved something fried from the salad, with a feeling of efficacy, into the soup, then ate it with a spoon. His steamed lobster with fries and Laura’s broiled monkfish with mesclun salad arrived. He ate his fries using all his butter and ketchup and, at her offer, most of Laura’s butter. “I feel better,” he murmured.“What?”“I feel better, due to Xanax, I think. How do you feel?”“I don’t know,” said Laura. “Okay, I guess.”At Paul’s apartment they drank green juice and showered, then performed oral sex on each other, showered again, turned off the light to sleep. Paul said they should be on Xanax all the time. Laura said “we’re probably ideal candidates for Xanax prescriptions.”“I’m sure that we are,” said Paul, and went to the bathroom with his MacBook and, seated on the toilet, looked at lobsters’ Wikipedia page. He typed “immortal animals” in Google and clicked “The Only Immortal Animal on Earth” and saw a jellyfish on a website that looked like it was made in the late ’90s. He copied a sentence, a few minutes later, from Taipei Metro’s Wikipedia page—“The growing traffic problems of the time, compounded by road closures due to TRTS construction led to what became popularly known as the ‘Dark Age of Taipei Traffic”—and emailed it to Laura.Paul entered his room carrying his open MacBook. “This is what you ate,” he said showing Laura a photo, captioned “a monkfish in a market,” of a glistening, black, mound-shaped mass—grotesque in a melancholy, head-dominated, almost whimsical manner—and she laughed a little.Ten days later they were on Laura’s bed in Baltimore, around 3:45 a.m., watching a Japanese movie about a woman who tortures and murders men. The past two nights they’d ingested large doses of MDMA and low-to-medium doses of Percocet, Adderall, Xanax and today they’d only used a little Adderall. Paul began to sometimes leverage himself above Laura, who would roll onto her back, or remain on her side, loosely enclosed by Paul’s arms to either side, as he stared vertically down at her with fixed, impractical, “scary” expressions.Laura laughed and, the first two times, complimented his effort, then told him to stop, after which he did it again, and thought he wouldn’t anymore, then did again, five minutes later, on an impulse, almost uncontrollably—hovering low, with bent elbows, feeling both insane and, in the private room behind the one-way mirror of his exaggeratedly happy expression, like an experimental psychologist—and she began crying in a helpless and cowering manner, which Paul, to  some degree, thought was feigned, so remained motionless, for two seconds, during which Laura’s face appeared unrecognizable, like the irreducible somethingness of her, in the form of a coded overlay, or invisible mask, had abruptly left, revealing the frightening activity—the arbitrarily reconfiguring, look-less chaos—of a personless face. Paul hugged her so she couldn’t see his face and repeatedly said he was sorry and variations of “it’s me” and “it’s okay.” Laura’s eyes appeared strangely collapsed beyond closure, like rubber bands overlapping themselves, for a few seconds, after she stopped crying. “It’s just that my car is broken,” she said earnestly. “I can’t get away.”“I would have stopped if I knew you were this scared,” said Paul, confused by what she’d been thinking to have imagined escaping in a car.“You should have stopped when I said stop.”“But people always say to stop. And you were laughing.”“I told you to stop,” said Laura. “You did other times and I kept going and you liked it.”“I know,” said Laura, and described how she’d lately felt depressed in a new and scary way, which Paul also had felt lately and described as a sadness-based fear, immune to tone and interpretation, as if not meant for humans—more visceral than sadness, but unlike fear because it decreased heart rate and impaired the senses, causing everything to seem “darker.” Sometimes it was less of a feeling than a realization that maybe, after you died, in the absence of time, without a mechanism for tolerance, or means of communication, you could privately experience a nightmare state for an eternity. More than once, the past few weeks, Paul had wondered—idly, without thinking past hypothesis—if books and movies he viewed as melodramatic might be accurately depicting what, since before his book tour, he now sometimes felt. They diagnosed themselves with “severely depleted serotonin  levels,” caused by forty to eighty doses of MDMA the past three to five months. As Laura’s apartment brightened from the morning sun, through sixth-floor windows, they prepared to sleep. Laura stood at a window eating pink tablets that seemed huge—“disk-like,” thought Paul with a blanket covering all but his head.They looked at each other neutrally.“I feel like those aren’t good for you,” said Paul.Laura said a doctor had recommended them and Paul said something implying it was healthier to never listen to doctors.“How do you know it’s not good for me?”“You’ll become dependent, to some degree.”“No, I won’t, I rarely take it,” said Laura.“You’ll become dependent to a little degree, I’m just saying.”“Did you read about that somewhere?”“Not specifically,” said Paul.“How do you know, then?”“Based on what I know, from things I’ve read and experienced, about tolerance, I think your body will be less able to produce something each time you use those.”“That’s not how everything works,” said Laura.“I’m not trying to argue with you, based on what I know,” said Paul, aware it was funny to qualify “I’m not trying to argue with you” with “based on what I know,” but not feeling humored. He was standing, around twenty minutes later—and had bought a ticket with his iPhone for a bus leaving in an hour—looking at Laura, sitting on her bed facing away. They were both crying a little. It was below freezing and gusty outside, but Paul declined Laura’s offer of a jacket and multiple offers to drive him to the bus stop—on an unsheltered bridge—and said bye and self-consciously left.• • •In early May, more than two months later, Paul was outside Bobst Library waiting for Peanut—to buy drugs for the next three days, when he and Laura would be in Pittsburgh, for a reading, then in Calvin’s mansion for two nights—when he saw Juan walking past and asked what he was doing. Juan said he was buying a Clif Bar and going to the gym and asked what Paul was doing.“I’m meeting someone to buy drugs.”“What drugs are you buying?”Peanut was approaching on the sidewalk.“I’ll tell you after, he’s there, he probably won’t want to see you,” said Paul remembering once when he and Laura got in Peanut’s car and Peanut became very still a few seconds before quietly saying “yo,” and that he’d expected one person.“I didn’t know you was a writer,” said Peanut.“Yeah,” said Paul.“What books you’ve written?”“Like five books,” said Paul.“A book’s a book,” said Peanut, and Paul got in his car. The middle-aged woman in the driver’s seat was wearing a baseball cap. Paul wasn’t sure if she’d worn it every other time or no other time. Paul asked if Peanut had mushrooms. “No,” said Peanut. “But I’m working on that for you.”“What else do you have on you?”“On me? I’ve got a bundle of dope.”Paul, walking toward Think Coffee, where Laura was working on writing, told Juan he bought Ketamine, MDMA, Xanax. Juan said when he tried Ketamine he felt like he could feel the solar system flying through space and that he had been on his bed and had pointed the top of his head in the same  direction. Paul said he also bought heroin and Juan said he knew people when he was in high school (in Kansas, where he had been arrested for selling marijuana, Paul uncertainly knew) who used heroin and one had died.“What do you mean?” said Paul vaguely.“I think he died,” said Juan, and they slowed to a kind of loitering, as a policeman, behind them, walked past. They stood in place, then continued walking.“When did they die?”“I’m not really sure,” said Juan.“He died,” said Paul grinning. “How?”“I don’t know.”“Why did he die?”“I don’t know. I just know he died.”In the morning, while driving, Paul listened to music through earphones and photographed Laura—asleep with her head, against the passenger window, cushioned by the fluffy, patchwork, faded blanket loosely wrapping all but her face, like an oversize astronaut suit with no visor—around ten times with his iPhone. In Baltimore a few days ago she had been drinking tequila alone while cleaning her apartment—she was moving into her father’s small house, in which a middle-aged couple rented a room—and later while driving had been stopped by the police. Her mother had screamed at her in an out-of-control manner and her father, somewhat unexpectedly, had gone into “nice mode.” Paul remembered a night, eating dinner with Michelle in her mother’s house, when he had said he felt depressed. Michelle had gone upstairs silently—the house had thick, soft carpeting everywhere, even on the stairs, so that people sometimes appeared or disappeared without warning—and  cried on her bed. Paul was surprised he’d forgotten that night, and emailed himself with his iPhone—Remembered being depressed at dinner w Michelle in empty houseWhile driving to Pittsburgh w Laura asleepTyped on iPhone in Gmail w right handListening to P. S. EliotLeft hand on steering wheel—then vaguely remembered another time when he had remembered the same dinner and had also felt surprised that he’d forgotten.Paul and Laura were both upset—their default, while sober, at this point—when they arrived in Pittsburgh and each ingested 2mg Xanax. Paul, on a sidewalk outside Laura’s car, watched Calvin and Maggie, both grinning, as they approached and hid behind a dumpster, then walked to Paul, who had a depressed expression, which he didn’t attempt to hide or mollify.“Hi,” said Calvin after a few seconds.“We should go to Whole Foods,” said Paul.“Is there a Whole Foods here?” said Maggie.“Yes, I’ve been there like ten times,” said Paul peripherally aware of Laura exiting her car. “This is where my ex-girlfriend lived. Michelle.” He looked at Calvin and Maggie, unsure if they knew of Michelle. In Whole Foods he walked aimlessly at a quick, undeviating pace, with a sensation of haunting the location. He ladled clam chowder into the largest size soup container, chose a baguette, stood in line.• • •After the reading, which was on the second floor of a bar, Paul stood in a shadowy room, at a billiards table, eating his baguette and soup. He said “we should have an orgy tonight” to Calvin, who seemed hesitant but curious. Maggie entered the room and stood with them and Paul said “we should have an orgy tonight.”“Yeah, seems good,” said Maggie in an uncharacteristic monotone.“But we should film it,” said Paul.“No, I don’t know,” said Maggie with unfocused eyes.“Once we’re on MDMA we won’t care,” said Paul. “About anything.”“Maggie’s seventeen,” said Calvin grinning weakly.“That’s not underage. We can black out her face.”“I’m not doing that,” said Maggie.“It’s not worth doing at all if it’s not filmed,” said Paul.“I don’t want to be filmed,” said Maggie.“She doesn’t want to be filmed,” said Calvin.Laura entered the room and began playing catch with Maggie with a billiards ball. Paul sat on a stack of ten to fifteen chairs and continued eating his baguette and soup, feeling distantly like he was avoiding something that would eventually end his life, except it wasn’t avoidable and when it did end his life he wouldn’t know, because he wouldn’t know anything.“Should we switch cars, on the drive back?” said Calvin. “Like, Paul and Maggie in Maggie’s car, me and Laura in Laura’s car?”“I don’t know,” said Paul.“Someone else decide, I’m going to my car to get my sandwich,” said Maggie, and went downstairs. Laura was cleaning a stain on the billiards table, it seemed, at the edge of Paul’s peripheral vision. Paul went downstairs, where he sat alone in a booth and texted Maggie, asking what kind of sandwich she was eating.At a red light, around half an hour later, Paul threw a clementine at Laura’s car, which was ahead. The light turned green and the clementine missed Laura’s moving car. Paul got back in Maggie’s car, said he wondered what Calvin and Laura were talking about. “I feel sleepy from the food and Percocet,” he said around ten minutes later.“I like sleeping when I’m cold rather than when I’m warm.”“Me too,” said Paul. “Are you going to be hungry tonight?”“Yeah,” said Maggie after a pause.“I kind of want to eat spaghetti,” said Paul, and laughed a little. “Or something.”“I’ll make spaghetti,” said Maggie. “No, I don’t want to eat spaghetti,” said Paul. “Oh, I thought you wanted to eat spaghetti.”“I don’t know,” said Paul quickly, and a few minutes later Maggie said her brother turned 4 recently and would say things like “my three-year-old self hates cucumbers” but wouldn’t talk about his two-year-old or one-year-old self, which Maggie thought was interesting and wanted to ask why, but kept forgetting.At Calvin’s house everyone ingested more Percocet and Xanax and went in the basement, where Maggie and Calvin each ate a bowl of cereal and Paul, ignoring everyone, to a large degree, talked to Charles on Gmail chat, eventually eating three bowls of cereal. In bed, around 1:30 a.m., Laura asked what Paul and Charles had talked about.“Nothing,” said Paul automatically. “We just talked about feeling depressed.”“What else did you talk about?”“I don’t remember,” said Paul.“Try to,” said Laura.“You can just read it tomorrow.”“Can I read it now?”“Just read it tomorrow,” said Paul.“Why can’t I read it now?”“Okay,” said Paul, and opened his MacBook.He woke, on his back, to Calvin looking at him from the doorway. He asked if Calvin had used any drugs today. Calvin said he hadn’t, and they looked at each other.“You haven’t?” said Paul. “Today?”“Well, a Percocet, when I woke up.”“When you woke up,” said Paul in a monotone.“Oh yeah—your alarm is going off,” said Calvin to Laura. “That’s what I came here, to tell you.”“Oh, damn,” said Laura, and left the room.“Are . . . you and Laura. . . having problems?”“No,” said Paul, and laughed a little.Calvin appeared tired, slightly anxious.“I mean . . . no,” said Paul looking at the ceiling. “No.”“I’m going to my room,” said Calvin after a few seconds.When Laura returned, five minutes later, Paul asked where she’d been.“In the bathroom,” she said. “Where were you?”“What do you mean? I’ve been right here.”“I was in the bathroom. Sorry I didn’t tell you.”“What do you mean ‘where were you?’ I was here when you left.”“I know. I’m sorry. I was trying to make a joke. It was . . . ‘in bad taste,’ I guess.”“Don’t apologize about that,” said Paul.After a few seconds Laura rolled over. “I misinterpreted what you said,” she said facing away. “I don’t want to do that in the future.”“Stop apologizing,” said Paul.“I’m not apologizing,” said Laura.“Okay. Just stop talking about it.”Laura went in the bathroom attached to the guest room, and when the shower turned on Paul immediately heard a quiet, soporific crying like something from nature. He saw Calvin and Maggie jogging into the room and covered himself with a blanket and they jumped on the bed, then repeatedly in place.In Calvin’s SUV, that night, on the way to Target to buy hair dye, because Calvin wanted to dye and cut his hair “really weird,” and Maggie had earnestly said “I think I want to color my face too,” Laura asked if anyone wanted Xanax; everyone did, in different amounts, which she apportioned. To her right, gently isolated in a one-person seat, holding half a Xanax bar, which was guaranteed to have an effect on him within forty minutes, Paul felt a quaintly affecting comfort and a self-conscious, fleeting urge to ask someone a question or say something nice to someone.He thought of how, from elementary through high school, if a girl had been nice to him at school or if he got a valuable baseball or Magic: The Gathering card or if he accomplished something in a video or computer game—if for whatever reason he felt significantly, temporarily happier—he would get an urge to talk to his mother and sometimes would go find her, at her makeup station in her bathroom, or outside  watering plants, then reveal something about his life or ask her a question about her life, knowing he was making her happy, for a few minutes, before running back to the TV, Nintendo, or computer. Sometimes, half mock scolding, mostly as an amused observation of human nature (she’d also say she recognized the behavior in herself, that she was the same way, with certain people), Paul’s mother would tell Paul, who almost always answered her questions, her attempts at conversation, with “I don’t know” in a kind of vocal cursive, without disconnected syllables, that he shouldn’t only talk to her—to his “poor mother,” she’d say—when he felt like talking.Gradually, after being the target a few times of a similar capriciousness, which he discerned as default behavior for most people, and not liking it, Paul learned to not be more generous or enthusiastic or attentive than he could sustain regardless of his mood and to not talk to people if his only reason to was because he felt lonely or bored.In college, junior and senior year, when he’d deliberately remained friendless—after his first relationship ended—to focus on writing what became his first book, he would force himself to email his mother (his only regular communication, those two years, once every two to four days) even when he felt depressed and unmotivated. He would always feel better after emailing, knowing his mother would be happy and that, by mastering some part of himself, he’d successfully felt less depressed without bothering, impeding—or otherwise being a distraction in—anyone’s life.Target was closed for an unknown reason. Paul was quiet during the ten-minute drive back to Calvin’s mansion, dimly remembering once sitting close with Laura in another back-seat, also at night, holding cups of hot tea for warmth. His memories had increasingly occurred to him without context, outside of linear time, like single poems on sheets of computer paper, instead of pages from a book with the page number and book title on top.They used all their MDMA in Calvin’s basement while eating cake, ham, salad, cookies—the first time Paul had eaten food for comfort while on MDMA—then went upstairs to Calvin’s room, where Calvin and Maggie drank beer, which Paul and Laura, who had eaten only a little food, declined. Paul began recording, at some point, with his MacBook. “Isn’t it a thing?” he said after ingesting Codeine and Flexeril. “That people warn against? Combining drugs.”“Yeah,” said Calvin, and laughed.“I don’t think that’s true,” said Laura shyly.“I’m on like eight things now,” said Paul.Calvin asked if Laura wanted to smoke marijuana and she asked if Paul would be okay with that and Paul said yes, thinking he didn’t like that she had asked. While Laura and Calvin smoked in the bathroom, with the door closed so Calvin’s parents wouldn’t smell it, Paul and Maggie created a GIF of a baseball cap moving around on their heads. Maggie, when Paul said he wanted to smoke marijuana, said he shouldn’t because of his lung collapse history. Paul began coughing nonstop after smoking and repeatedly said his chest burned and fell, half deliberately, to the floor, grinning in a stereotypically marijuana-induced manner, he could feel, as he tried, with his MacBook, to find information on the internet about his situation.“I feel like I’m unsarcastically viewing this as a major ordeal,” said Calvin.“I’m just trying to Google ‘burned lung,’ I’m not doing anything to indicate what you said,” said Paul in an agitated voice while grinning. “I’m just idly looking up ‘burned lung’ variations on the internet.”“I was also viewing this as major until Paul just said that,” said Laura.Paul lay facedown, at some point, on one of the two beds in the room and heard Calvin say “what if he’s dead?” and imagined Laura shrugging. When he woke, four hours later, on his side, Laura was holding him from behind.They spoke once—at a rest stop, when Paul said it was his turn to drive and Laura said she was okay with continuing—during the four-hour drive to Brooklyn, arriving around midnight and sleeping until late in the afternoon, when Laura said she was buying groceries from LifeThyme and driving back to Baltimore. Paul asked if she wanted to “stay and eat dinner on Xanax” before leaving.At Sel De Mer, that night, Laura said Paul had been ignoring her all weekend and that she felt depressed. Paul said he’d focused on doing what he wanted, on talking to Charles, instead of complaining that he was unhappy. Laura said Paul did complain, to Charles.“I don’t remembering complaining to him,” said Paul.“You said you don’t feel happy around me,” said Laura.“I said I don’t feel happy no matter what. I also said I don’t feel interested in anyone except you.”“You said you felt interested in other girls sexually.”“That isn’t complaining,” said Paul. “We talked about a lot of things.” Charles had seemed to be having the same “relationship problems” with his girlfriend as before Mexico and had said he was planning a similar, solitary trip to Asia. Paul had suggested Charles write a novel called Mexico, plotted around his problems with Jehan, who was still in Mexico but had been active on the internet, regularly writing on Charles’ Facebook wall and, unless it had been a different Jehan, adding Paul on Goodreads.• • •After dinner, in Paul’s room, Laura asked if she was “going home now.” Paul lay unresponsive on his mattress facing away. Laura said she “wanted to buy groceries from LifeThyme before leaving.” Paul rolled onto his back and, with only the top half of his head visible, said “I think it would be better if you didn’t stay tonight” through the muzzle-y screen of his blanket. He felt “completely motionless,” he thought, on his mattress, with his eyes closed, as Laura gathered her belongings. He heard her say “I agree with what you said about how if it doesn’t work out then it doesn’t work out, but I wanted to say that I like knowing you and I hope it works out.”Without knowing exactly why, but sensing, on some level, that his feeling was mostly vicarious—that he was experiencing what he suspected Laura would experience, in a few seconds, once she discerned his sincere lack of response—Paul felt a sympathetically cringing sensation that he wished Laura hadn’t said what she had said. Mechanically, with the lightness of bones that could move, he stood and hugged her briefly, without looking at her face.Six hours later, when birds were chirping but it was still dark outside, Paul was sitting on his mattress watching what he’d recorded in Calvin’s room. He noticed that he hadn’t been in Calvin’s room—he didn’t remember where he’d gone, maybe downstairs to the kitchen—for a few minutes, during which Laura had spoken in a louder, more confident voice and openly debated if she wanted a beer. Maggie, Paul saw in the movie, had asked Laura if Paul drank alcohol and Laura had said “sometimes,” then Maggie had asked what kind and Laura had said “beer, and sometimes tequila,” in a subtly, complicatedly different voice like that of a shyer, less friendly version of herself.  Hearing this, aware that Laura would normally attribute non-firsthand information, that she’d say she had read about him drinking tequila, Paul began crying a little.He lay against a pile of blankets and pillows, away from his MacBook, unsure why he felt emotional. Gradually he realized he’d intuited her voice sounded different because she had probably assumed, to some degree, that only she knew—and only she would ever know—of the aberration in her behavior and, while saying “beer, and sometimes tequila,” maybe had distractedly felt an uncommon nearness to herself that Paul, knowing this in secret from her, had also felt.Two months later, in mid-July, around a week after Paul turned 28, Calvin and Maggie were in Brooklyn for five days to act in a low-budget movie. They were no longer in a relationship. They met Paul and Laura on a Friday night at Sel De Mer, where Laura gave everyone Xanax and Calvin shared a marijuana cookie with everyone and Maggie, who hadn’t eaten meat in two years, ordered lobster. They confirmed to snort heroin in Paul’s room after dinner, then go to the Union Square theater to “group livetweet” whatever movie fit their schedule. They would sit separately during the movie and communicate only through tweets, in service of making the experience “more fun and interesting,” said Paul, who anticipated wanting to be alone in the theater.At Paul’s apartment Maggie volunteered to help Paul juice fennel, celery, cucumber, lemon while Laura showered and Calvin did something in Paul’s room. Paul, who had been silent most of the night, partly because he and Laura ingested 2mg Xanax each before dinner, asked if Maggie had asked her brother about “the thing,” which he was surprised he remembered.“Shit. Yeah. I forgot to tell you.”“What did he say?”“I don’t remember,” said Maggie absently.“Are you depressed about you and Calvin?”“Yeah. I don’t want to talk to him. I feel really depressed.”Paul organized three bags of heroin into four different-size piles—Maggie only wanted a little—while Laura bought tickets for X-Men: First Class at 12:35 a.m. Paul drew lines connecting three names to three lines of heroin and heard Calvin say “I think I just figured out I can be happy no matter what people around me are doing” to what seemed to be himself and earnestly thought “funny” in a monotone with a neutral expression, then snorted his heroin and showered and ingested 15mg Adderall, two Advil, half a marijuana cookie. Paul vomited on the street twice before they got in a taxi with Laura in the front passenger seat and Maggie in the backseat between Paul and Calvin, who was commenting on the taxi’s TV, which was talking about Shaquille O’Neal.“You should tweet it, stop talking about it,” said Paul, and opened his door at a red light to vomit, but didn’t and received from someone a plastic bag, which he vomited in twice with an overall sensation of disconcern-based serenity. He tweeted “in cab to theater, ‘already’ vomited twice (jk re seeming to imply xmen will make me vomit)” and read a tweet that said “put hand through cab glass to pet Paul as he vomited into a bag, cabdriver looked at me in a sitcom-like way” and said “Laura, you forgot the hashtag” while staring at his own tweet. “I forgot the hashtag also. We’re all just going to keep forgetting it. What’re we going to do?”“I recommend copy and pasting.” said Laura.“We’re all just going to keep forgetting it,” said Paul “pessimistically,” he thought, and when he exited the taxi he walked into, instead of onto, the sidewalk and fell stumbling ahead in an uninhibited, loosely controlled, briefly uncontrolled manner reminiscent of childhood, when this partial  to complete abandonment of body and/or limb (of rolling like a log on carpet, falling face-first onto beds, being dragged by an arm or both legs through houses or side yard, floating in swimming pools, lying upside down in headstands on sofas) was normal, allowing his unexpected momentum to naturally expend, falling horizontally for an amusingly far length. He imagined continuing forward in a pretending of momentum, transitioning into a jog, disappearing into the distance. He vomited on the street, then turned around and jogged to Maggie, who stood motionless with a preoccupied expression.“I’m okay,” said Paul. “Where are they? Calvin, Laura.”“Buying water,” said Maggie.“How do you feel?”“Floaty,” said Maggie with a neutral expression. “Good. How do you feel?”“Good,” said Paul smiling. “I just used too much.”When they entered the theater the movie had already begun. Paul sat in a stadium-seated area, above and behind everyone else in the front area. After a few minutes he went to Maggie, who was in an isolated seat, on the right side of the theater. Maggie pointed at Laura and Calvin, twenty feet away, talking to each other.“We agreed to sit separately,” said Maggie.“I want separately also,” said Paul.“I feel upset,” said Maggie.“I’m going to see what’s happening,” said Paul, and crossed an aisle, past five empty seats, to Laura, as Calvin left the theater. Laura said Calvin had wanted to share her phone. Paul said Calvin “should just go charge it for like ten minutes.”“I know. That’s what I said. He’s doing that now.”“Calvin went to charge his phone,” said Paul to Maggie, and returned to his seat. He tweeted “someone in my row is snoring #xmenlivetweet” and “kevin bacon had something like 10 hands #xmenlivetweet.” Maggie tweeted she wanted more heroin. Paul tweeted “i can hear someone snoring ~8 seats to my left #xmenlivetweet” and saw Maggie leave the theater and stared absently as Kevin Bacon talked to people. Kevin Bacon walked outside, where it was snowing, then he turned around and talked to the same people as before, who had followed him. Paul tried to remember why Kevin Bacon had gone outside. He read tweets from Maggie that said “feeling lonely #xmenlivetweet” and “i am in the bathroom contemplating chugging my beer,” which had no hashtag. Paul saw that Laura had left the theater. Paul cautiously entered the women’s bathroom, a few minutes later, hearing Maggie’s voice and movement noises from the handicapped stall.“Excuse me, ma’am,” said Paul in a loud, authoritative voice, and the movement noises stopped.“Yes?” said Laura after a pause.“It’s me,” said Paul.“Oh, shit,” said Maggie, and the door opened.“I was scared,” said Laura, partly in view.“You’re in the women’s bathroom,” said Maggie.“Sorry,” said Paul grinning, and left and sat on the carpeted floor near an emergency exit and tweeted “where is everyone . . . i’m sitting in darkness near the women’s bathroom #xmenlivetweet” and that he was going to try to scare Laura and Maggie again. He read “just stood up, lost ‘all control’ of left leg and fell into an arcade game, making a loud noise and ‘yelping’ #xmenlivetweet” by Calvin. He read “someone just said ‘we did it!’ while seeming to float in an indoor ‘future area’ #xmenlivetweet” by Laura. He heard Maggie’s voice and walked quickly to her and Laura and thrust his glass bottle of water at them but water didn’t leave the bottle until, as the bottle neared himself, some splashed onto his chin and neck. Calvin was sitting on the floor by the candy machines, smiling calmly at his phone. Laura gave Paul and Maggie tea-tree toothpicks. Paul went in the theater to his seat and tweeted “why is ‘beast’ flying a jet plane . . . #xmenlivetweet” and “is this world war 2, i don’t understand anything #xmenlivetweet” and “i’m going to stand to look at who has been snoring loudly for ~15 min. #xmenlivetweet” and “someone seems to be laying across 2 seats sleeping #xmenlivetweet.” He became aware of the tea-tree toothpick’s wiggling, outside his mouth, and of his intensely concentrating expression, as he worked on editing a tweet, a few minutes after credits had begun scrolling down the screen, when the white shape, of Laura in a white dress, in Paul’s peripheral vision, stopped enlarging, indicating an arrival.In the lobby, by the bathrooms, Paul said he felt nauseated. “I feel,” said Laura, and was quiet for around five seconds. “Never mind.” Paul asked carefully, with vague aversion toward himself, if she usually thought of what to say before speaking, or would start talking without thinking. “I think at least fifty percent of it before talking, I think,” said Laura. “Why?”Paul said it was annoying sometimes to wait for her to think, and they stopped talking—Calvin and Maggie were ahead, sometimes looking back—until they got on the L train, when Paul apologized for saying it was annoying and said he understood her behavior. Laura quietly said it was okay. Paul asked if she felt okay and she said she did, and asked if Paul did. Maggie jumped in front of them and posed with the sleeping, drooling, middle-aged man in an opposite seat. “I’m okay with everything,” said Paul distractedly, with some confusion, after moving his iPhone into position and photographing only the middle-aged man because Maggie had returned to her seat.“Are you sure?” said Laura.“Yeah. I’m okay with everything if you are.”“I am,” said Laura.“I feel nauseated,” said Paul a few minutes later. “But I’m okay with everything. If I’m not talking it’s because I’m nauseated.”“Okay,” said Laura. “Thank you for telling me.”In the large deli below Harry’s apartment Paul walked away, at one point, from everyone else and, alone in an aisle, turned into a barrier-like display of heavily discounted tomato sauce. None fell, or seemed to have been disturbed, or affected, to any degree, and no one saw. After buying beer, fennel, celery, a plastic bag of apples, three lemons and walking six blocks Paul and Laura sat on a sidewalk waiting for Calvin and Maggie to get their sleeping bags from where they’d been staying.“You’re really quiet suddenly,” said Laura.“I’m really nauseated,” said Paul, and rested the weight of his head facedown on his open palms, covering his eyes and cheeks and forehead. It began raining lightly, in a mist, as if onto produce, or probably an air conditioner was dripping condensation. Paul weakly tried to remember what month it was, stopping after a few seconds, and moved his shoulders to indicate he didn’t want to be touched when Laura began rubbing his back.Maggie was in the bathroom and Paul was sitting cross-legged on his mattress, around half an hour later, absently reading descriptions of mutants on X-Men: First Class’s Wikipedia page—“scientist who is transformed into a frightening-looking mutant in an effort to cure himself, but is kind at heart”—when Calvin asked if “anyone” wanted to sit with him on the front stoop while he smoked.“Me. I will,” said Laura, who had been drying her hair with a towel after showering, and Paul saw her looking at herself in the wall mirror. He clicked “Kevin Bacon” and looked at the words “Kevin Bacon (disambiguation)” without thinking anything for a vague amount of time, until Maggie entered the room, when he stood and went in the bathroom and heard Laura say “actually, I’ll have a beer” and Calvin say “really?” and “cool.” The thick carpet of the bathmat, folded like a soft taco, was in the bathtub, sopping and heavy. Paul thought with some confusion that Maggie must’ve put it there, maybe for slippage prevention. While showering he thought about what he’d done during the filming, last year, August to December, of X-Men: First Class: hid in his room, gone on a book tour, gotten married, visited his parents. He entered his room wearing boxer shorts—Maggie was sitting in a far corner looking at her MacBook with a serious expression—and turned around and put on a shirt, sat on his mattress, placed his MacBook on his lap, stared at the words “Bacon in 2007” with slightly unfocused eyes. Maggie said she had a stomachache and moved onto the mattress asking if Paul wanted beer, which she held toward him and which he mutely held a few seconds before moving it near Maggie, who drank some and put it on the floor and resettled herself on the mattress with the sides of their knees touching.“Calvin and Laura have been gone so long,” said Paul.“Maybe they’re watching the sunrise,” said Maggie.“I don’t think you can see it from here.”“Maybe they went somewhere.”“I don’t think you can see it from anywhere near here.”“I don’t know where they are,” said Maggie.“Do you feel depressed still?”“Yeah,” said Maggie.“Because of you and Calvin?”“Yeah.”“Did you end the relationship or him?”“It was me,” said Maggie. “He didn’t want it to end.” She said she felt depressed because she’d been really close with Calvin, so now something in her life felt missing. Paul asked about the singer, of a punk band he listened to often in high school, who had kissed Maggie, she’d said in an email, in someone’s car after a concert. Maggie said the singer didn’t want to bring her in his hotel room because his friends would think it was weird she was 17 and that he wanted to perform oral sex on her but she didn’t want that and he’d said they could “get naked but not have sex” and Maggie had said she didn’t know what that meant. Then the singer had told intimate secrets about his ex-girlfriend. Paul had idly opened iMovie on his MacBook and they’d been absently looking at it, not recording, as they talked and he accidentally clicked—and quickly closed—one of the movies.“That might be porn. Laura and I made a porn.”“What’s that?” said Maggie pointing at “ketamine.”“A drug we used before going to Urban Outfitters.”“It seems like you and Laura have a lot of fun together. Is that true?”Paul said they saw each other once every ten days and usually started “fighting” after one or two days. Maggie asked what they fought about. Paul vaguely remembered when, on a large dose of Xanax, alone one night in his room, he fell on his way to his mattress to sleep—pulling down his high chair and causing his shoulder, he discovered upon waking eleven hours later, to bleed heavily from two places into a dark pile on his mattress—only slightly aware that this was unrelated to Maggie’s question. Paul remembered when he calculated three divided by two as three-fourths regarding an amount of heroin and vomited steadily eight to ten hours, beginning around noon. He and Laura, who’d been resilient, maybe from weeks of Percocet after her car accident, had  snorted the miscalculated heroin upon waking and, after riding the L train, he’d begun vomiting—near Union Square on streets and sidewalks, in Pure Food and Wine’s bathroom, while walking thirteen blocks south, in Bobst Library’s bathrooms. When they left the library at night he stopped every ten to fifteen feet to vomit nothing and Laura began expressing a previously suppressed concern, insisting Paul drink water. Paul vomited repeatedly after each sip and sat—and, at one point, briefly, lay—on the sidewalk outside a New York University dorm by Washington Square Park, inaudibly mumbling that he was okay and, when Laura said she wanted to call an ambulance, barely perceptibly shaking his head no with a sensation of reluctantly imparting an ancient wisdom. In his room, an hour later, around 9:30 p.m., Laura wanted Paul, covered by his blanket on his mattress, to drink a glass of water and didn’t think he should be lying with eyes closed because people in his situation died by sleeping. After an increasingly tense exchange culminating with Paul “sarcastically,” he thought, chugging the large glass of water—in a display of functioning that probably seemed unlike that of a dying person— Laura, to some degree spitefully, Paul felt, had said she was driving home to Baltimore and, to Paul’s surprise, had left him to sleep alone.“Just . . . things,” said Paul, and laughed a little.Maggie was staring at his MacBook’s screen.“Different things,” said Paul.“I’m just curious,” said Maggie in a frustrated voice.“I know,” said Paul staring at the cursor on the screen, repeatedly disappearing and reappearing in the same place.“Can I watch some of a movie?”“Yeah,” said Paul. “Which one?”“Your favorite one. Not the porn.”Paul clicked a ninety-two-minute movie beginning in his apartment, when he and Laura had returned for ecstasy because he’d vomited his MDMA. Paul clicked near the end of the movie. Laura was describing, in “the voice,” which they hadn’t used in months, how salmonella was harvested, in the residential area behind McDonald’s. In the movie Paul said something inaudible and Laura said “Android? You’re bringing Android into this? Amateur.” Paul clicked elsewhere and the movie showed solid black as Laura said “and here we have the brainchild, really, of this whole operation.” Descending to McDonald’s first floor, in the movie, Laura looked different than she did now, Paul thought, and for maybe the eighth time in the past month considered that she had subtly denser bones or unseen scar tissue now that her face had fully healed. Paul stopped the movie and the vanished image, of Laura and the Christmas tree, reappeared instantly in his memory, looking similar, being already memory-like, on the screen, from low resolution. Manhattan seemed gothic and lunar, in the movies of that night, with the spare activity and structural density of a fully colonized moon that had been abandoned and was being recolonized; its science-fictional qualities seemed less advanced than ancient, haunted, of a future dark age.Maggie was showing Paul emails from the punk singer, after showing him writing she’d emailed to a magazine, when Laura and Calvin returned. Calvin asked what they were looking at and Maggie, closing her MacBook, said she was showing Paul writing she’d emailed to a magazine.“You guys are still awake?” said Laura. “What have you guys been doing?”“What were you guys doing?” said Paul in a quiet monotone, mentally stressing “you.” Laura went in the bathroom and Paul heard the sink turn on and, when she exited, asked if she had smoked cigarettes. She said Calvin had but she hadn’t. Paul removed his contact lenses and washed his face, and said he was going to sleep and lay facing away from Laura, who asked if he’d set his alarm. Paul said he’d set it for 2:30 p.m. (they’d agreed to be extras, in the movie Calvin and Maggie were in, tomorrow at 4:30 p.m.) and Laura asked if he was upset about something.“No, I want to sleep. I’m putting earplugs in.”“If you’re upset, tell me now instead of later.”“I want to sleep,” said Paul.“You seem upset. Can you tell me why?”Calvin and Maggie were unrolling their sleeping bags. Paul turned toward Laura, whose expression he couldn’t see without contact lenses, and loudly whispered “I feel upset you went outside for so long without talking to me first and that you kept asking me if I was okay when I told you I felt nauseated and that you keep asking me if I’m upset after I said I wasn’t” and turned away.“So you are upset,” said Laura after a few seconds.“I’m nauseated and want to sleep. I’m putting in earplugs.”Laura put an arm around him, and he stood and turned off the room’s light and lay facing away. After a few minutes Laura squished an arm under his neck, wrapping it around his chest to hug him tightly with both arms. Paul thought of the monk-fish he’d shown her—the light-absorbing mass of it, a silhouette of itself, Wikipedia’s stock image for monkfish—and felt emotional, and committed to not moving, then woke to his alarm. He kept his eyes closed, feigning sleep. He could faintly hear Maggie saying his name. “Paul, your alarm,” said Maggie louder, and touched his arm.He turned off the alarm and covered his head with his blanket, feeling tense and uncomfortable. He removed his earplugs, went in the bathroom, showered and moved quickly to his MacBook and looked at the internet sitting cross-legged on his bed, facing away from Laura, who was waking, it seemed. Paul could feel his left eyebrow twitching. Laura, after a few minutes, sat and said “has everyone showered?” in a voice that sounded loud and sleepy, as if contented. Paul, who felt an excruciating dread of being spoken to or looked at, was startled by how Laura was calmly, unself-consciously, nonchalantly directing attention toward herself. Paul emailed Laura while she showered and, after she blow-dried her hair, Calvin and Maggie left, saying they’d see Paul and Laura in an hour. Laura sat at the foot of the bed, facing away from Paul who lay on his back with his MacBook against his thighs, and they communicated by email (they’d agreed to type, not talk, whenever one of them, currently Paul, felt unable to speak in a friendly tone) for around fifty minutes, until Laura said “it seems like you don’t care about me” aloud.“I don’t,” said Paul. “I don’t right now.”“It seems that way.”“I know. I don’t care right now.”They were quiet a few seconds.“I’m going to Think Coffee,” said Laura, and went in the bathroom, then back in Paul’s room, then into the kitchen and out of the apartment. Paul slept three hours, then texted “how’s Think Coffee.” Laura responded she’d been wandering aimlessly on Xanax and hadn’t gotten there yet. Paul rode the L train to Union Square and walked toward the library, ten blocks south, to meet Laura for dinner, beneath a membranous and vaguely patterned sky like a faded, inconsistently worn red-and-blue blanket lit from the other side.If it were a blanket, Paul thought, beneath which existed only his imagination, he wouldn’t want to throw it off and be obliterated by the brightness of a child’s bedroom in daytime, or even peek outside, letting in the substrate of another world. Realizing this, as a medium dose of Xanax began taking effect, he felt a kind of safety in being where he was—inside the confines of what, to him, was everything—instead of “out there.”In Paul’s room, around 3:30 a.m., after ordering a lot of food at Lodge but eating only a little and talking calmly, then working on things a few hours on Adderall, they decided to eat psilocybin mushrooms Paul had bought a few weeks ago from Peanut. The light was off and they were on Paul’s mattress, forty minutes later, when Paul began asking what Laura, who seemed reluctant to answer, was thinking. She stood and turned on the light and asked where the “bag” of mushrooms was and, because she thought she was feeling it more than Paul, fed him the remaining amount and turned off the light.“We’re choosing to not talk, which itself is a communication, which seems good,” thought Paul holding Laura. “I’ll continue communicating in this manner, by not.” His steady, controlled petting of one of Laura’s vertebra with the cuticle of his right index finger gradually felt like his only method of remaining in concrete reality, where he and Laura, and other people, shared a world. Sometimes, forgetting what he was doing, his finger would slow or stop and he would become aware of a drifting sensation and realize he was being absorbed—from an indiscernible distance, beyond which he wouldn’t know how to return—and, with some urgency, move his body or open his eyes, seeing grid-like overlays on the walls and holograms of graph paper in the air, to interrupt his being taken. The effort became gradually smaller and more unconscious and, as if for something to do, in place of what was now automatic, Paul began to discern his rhythmic petting as a continuous striving to elicit certain information from Laura by responding or not responding to her rhythms, in a cycle whose goal was to produce momentary equilibriums. He felt increasingly attuned to the speed and quality of her breathing and heart rate, until he felt able to instantly discern changes in her physiology, which in entirety began to seem like an inconstant unit of unique, irreducible information (an ever-changing display of only prime numbers) that was continuously expressed and that bypassed the parts of them that allowed for deliberation or perception or intuition, beginning and ending in the only place where they were exactly together, undifferentiated and unknowable, but couldn’t, in their present form, ever reach, like a thing communicating directly with itself, rendering them both irrelevant.Paul began to sometimes laugh uncontrollably, with his face at the back of Laura’s neck, unsure what was funny. When he saw her frowning, a few minutes later, she burrowed her head against his chest and he said “what are you thinking about?” and she didn’t answer and, in an increasingly incredulous voice, like he mostly wanted to express how amazingly difficult it was to know—sometimes pausing after each word for emphasis—he repeatedly stated the question. “This isn’t what I expected at all,” he heard himself say, at some point, without knowing what he was referencing. He’d obviously wanted something good to happen, but what was happening wasn’t expected, based on what he’d said, therefore it must be bad. He was yawning, so was factually bored of Laura. “I feel like I can’t breathe,” he said, and suddenly stood and felt confused and unreal. He repeatedly fell onto his mattress, which every time seemed much less substantial than expected, dropping his body with increasing force and desperation, then lay on his back, unsatisfied and worried. “Sleeping, waking,” he said frustratedly. “Is there a difference? Am I dead?”“You’re not dead,” said Laura.“I think I’m dead,” said Paul distractedly, and covered his face with a blanket. He was thinking of how people say that when you die you experience your last moments for an eternity, when Laura yanked away the blanket and began tickling him and pulling him from the mattress as he giggled and intensely struggled, with confusion and frustration, to hide beneath the blanket. After succeeding, facedown with Laura sitting on his back, he seemed, while hidden, to not be thinking anything, then when he absently shifted to expose his face, to breathe, he believed he was insane. He asked if he was and Laura said no, which proved he was, because if he were he would ask and Laura would say he was not. He would never be sane, now that he was insane, he knew, then moved directly past that conclusion—unable to stop there, or anywhere—and believed again that he was dead and remembered hearing the word “bag” and thought of heroin and said “did we overdose?” He realized he would be alone if he was dead, even if Laura had also died—death would seal them into their own private afterlives—and, in idle correction, quietly said “did I overdose?”“I just have to deal with it,” he said in reference to being permanently alone, with only his weak projections of Laura and his room—requiring an amount of effort to sustain that was immense and debilitating, which was probably why, he realized, he couldn’t sate his breath, feel comfortable, think coherently—to occupy himself forever. “It’s okay,” he said, to begin some process of consolation, but felt only more despair and a panicked suspicion that he’d barely comprehended the terribleness of his situation. “This will go on for twenty years,” he said vaguely, and stood and slapped his thighs with both hands, then held the bathroom door’s frame with his arms in a V and his head hung down and repeatedly said “oh my god” while thinking “I can’t believe I OD’d” and failing to view his death—the horrible, inexcusable mistake of it—as interestingly absurd or blackly comic or anything except profoundly troubling. He fell facedown on a mound of blankets and pillows and rolled onto his back, suddenly contemplative. “I don’t remember that at all,” he said of the months, or years, when their drug use increased and they began injecting heroin, crudely visualizing a stereotypical montage of downward-spiraling drug use. “I don’t remember . . . that. But it must have happened . . . I just can’t believe I overdosed.”“You can’t overdose on mushrooms,” said Laura meekly.“I forgot we used mushrooms,” said Paul in a curious voice, but didn’t consider the information and immediately forgot again. “I think I am where you were twenty minutes ago, so you need to console me,” he said while thinking “that’s exactly what I would tell a projection to do if I were dead.” He tried to fondly recall a memory of his life, of life generally—he would need to learn to be satisfied with his memories, which was all he had now—and said “kissing is good” and “remember Las Vegas?” He said “Taiwan was good” knowing it hadn’t been, aware he was openly trying to deceive himself, then thought of tracing back his life to determine what caused the sequence of events leading to his overdose. “The book tour . . . after the summer. Remember Arby’s? In Florida?” He heard Laura say they never went to Florida and realized he was talking to himself while sustaining an imaginary companion and that he wasn’t saying what he was thinking. “Why do I keep thinking about RBIs, runs batted in? And something about Hank Aaron?” Paul believed again, at some point, that he was in the prolonged seconds before death, in which he had the opportunity to return to life—by discerning some code or pattern of connections in his memory, or remembering some of what had happened with a degree of chronology sufficient to re-enter the shape of his life, or sustaining a certain variety of memories in his consciousness long enough to be noticed as living and relocated accordingly. Lying on his back, on his mattress, he uncertainly thought he’d written books to tell people how to reach him, to describe the particular geography of the area of otherworld in which he’d been secluded.Paul was on his back on his mattress thinking “faces are circles,” and of cutting a face into four parts, as his room slowly brightened with indirect sunlight. Laura held his hand and he stood and went with her to the window and focused on the metaphysical area where he anticipated hearing her voice, wanting to be surprised, or to hear something consoling—apportioned from himself to his projection, to ventriloquize back to himself—about death. Laura was pointing at the sky, asking if Paul saw “that thing”—a pale, logo-like silhouette of antennae, or leafless plant, rising from a sixth-floor roof ’s corner, foregrounding a pink sky. Paul said he did, and that it looked pretty, he felt like a sleepy child willingly distracted from worries about a lost pet by a mother pointing at a star saying “everything will be okay, just focus on the twinkling—that’s where we came from and where we’ll be again, no matter what happens here, yes, I promise.”He held Laura’s hand and wandered somewhat aimlessly into the bathroom and picked up a tongue scraper. “You bought me this,” he said with dull, unfocused eyes. “I never used it. But I really appreciated it. I liked getting it. I never told you.” He put it down and disinterestedly thought “it’s not going to work,” as his hand idly turned a knob, and was surprised by the rupture and crackling of water, its instantaneous column of binary variations. He moved his hand into the water and was surprised again. “I didn’t expect that . . . to feel like that,” he said with a serious expression. “That’s really weird.” Realizing he had no concept of what water felt like until he touched it—cold, grasping, meticulous, aware—he felt self-conscious and said he wanted to pee alone. Sitting on the toilet, with the door closed, Paul realized he felt less discomfort and could breathe easier and that the surface of things was shinier and more dimensional from greater pixilation, all of which he viewed as evidence he was successfully convincing himself—through an increasingly elaborate, skillful, unconscious projection of a reality he would eventually believe he was exploring—that he wasn’t dead. With an eternity to practice, he realized, he would forget everything he had thought or felt while dead, including his current thoughts and feelings; he would only believe, as he once had, that he was alive.He was startled, entering his room, to see Laura already moving, as if independent of his perception. He briefly discerned her movement as incremental—not continuous, but in frames per second—and, like with insects or large predators, unpredictable and dangerous. He wanted to move backward and close the door and be alone again, in the bathroom, but Laura had already noticed him and, after a pause, distracted by her attention, he reciprocated her approach. They hugged a little, near the center of the room, then he turned around and moved toward the kitchen—dimly aware of the existence of other places, on Earth, where he could go—and was surprised when he heard himself, looking at his feet stepping into black sandals, say that he felt “grateful to be alive.” Posted by Nate at 3:36 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Older Post Home"

    "text": "EL: FORGET LAURA Tuesday, November 20, 2018 FORGET LAURA The next few days Paul texted Laura regularly, seemingly, he felt, out of \"catharsis\". Paul texted a photo of a display in the Mall of America of books titled I Can Make You Confident and I Can Make You Sleep with the author grinning on each cover. A day later Laura texted back a blurry photo of what seemed to be a headless mannequin wearing a suit and positioned in a begging or praying pose. Then she texted less, and with less attention, and one night didn’t respond to a photo Paul sent from a café, of a Back to the Future poster— He was never in timefor his classes . . .He wasn’t in timefor his dinner . . .Then one day . . .he wasn’t in histime at all.—until morning, when she texted “lol” and that she’d been asleep, but she didn’t reciprocate a photo, or ask a question, so they stopped texting. Paul sensed she was busy with music and maybe one or more vague relationships, and allowed himself to become “busy” also, to some degree, with other things, like organising his upcoming tour.

    "title": "EL: GO TO BOOK PARTY WITH DANIEL",
    "text": "EL: GO TO BOOK PARTY WITH DANIEL Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO TO BOOK PARTY WITH DANIEL The book party, like algae, feeling its way elsewhere, moved slowly but persistently from the bookstore’s basement to its  first floor, to the sidewalk outside, converging finally with other groups at a corner bar, where Paul failed more than five times to recognize or remember the faces or names of recent to long-term acquaintances—and twice introduced people he’d already introduced to each other, including Daniel and Frederick, both of whom however either feigned having not met or had actually forgotten—but due to 2mg Klonopin remained poised, with a peaceful sensation of faultlessness, physiologically calm but mentally stimulated, throughout the night, as if beta testing the event by acting like an exaggerated version of himself, for others to practice against, before the real Paul, the only person without practice, was inserted for the actual event. Fran left for her apartment, which she shared with a low-level cocaine dealer majoring in something art related at Columbia, to prepare a kind of pasta, “with a lot of things in it,” that was her specialty, it seemed. Paul and Daniel arrived ninety minutes later and Fran served a giant platter of cheese-covered, lasagna-like pasta—attractively browned in a mottled pattern of variations of crispiness—in small, colorful plastic bowls with buttered toast on which were thin slices of raw garlic. They ate all of it, then arranged themselves on Fran’s three-seat sofa and watched Drugstore Cowboy on Daniel’s MacBook. Paul was unable to discern the movie as coherent—he kept thinking the same scene, in a motel room, was replaying with minor variations—but was aware of sometimes commenting on the sound track, including that it was “really weird” and “unexpected.”Before becoming unconscious Paul was aware of a man wearing a cowboy hat being carried out of a drugstore by four people and of himself thinking that, if the people dragging the man were invisible, the man would look like he was gliding feetfirst on a horizontal waterslide, steadily ahead, with out-of-control limbs and a crazed, antagonistic expression, as if by experimentally self-directed telekinesis.• • •A week later Paul had organized plans to see Trash Humpers and was waiting for Fran and Daniel at the theater. He had breifly thought about asking Laura, who seemed to be now in a relationship with her ex-boyfriend—pictures had appeared on her reactivated Facebook in which they looked happily reunited in what seemed to be a faux-expensive hotel—to see the movie that she once said she wanted to see. Fran gave Paul six 10mg Adderall for her and Daniel’s tickets and a disoriented-seeming Daniel, who had no money left, asked if Paul had any snacks. Paul gave Daniel a sugar-free Red Bull he got from a Red Bull–shaped car parked outside the library and Daniel drank it in one motion with a neutral expression.“Fran said she’ll pay you back if you give me one of the Adderall she gave you,” whispered Daniel a few minutes into the movie. “I don’t think I can stay awake without it.” In the movie costumed actors made noises in parking lots and inside houses while destroying and/or “humping” inanimate objects. Paul woke, at one point, to Fran laughing loudly when no one else in the small, sold-out theater was laughing. When Paul wasn’t asleep he felt distracted by a feeling that Daniel had eerily turned his head 90 degrees and was staring at him, but each time he looked Daniel was either asleep or looking at the screen. The last ten minutes of the movie Paul was peripherally aware of Daniel’s unsupported head continually lolling in place and twitching to attention in a manner reminiscent of a middle/high school student struggling and repeatedly failing to remain awake in a morning class. Daniel seemed fully alert seconds after the movie ended. Paul asked how he slept despite Adderall and Red Bull.“Susie-Q,” said Daniel with a smirk-like grin indicating both earnest disapproval and a kind of fondness toward Seroquel and its intense, often uncomfortable tranquilizing  effects—as if, believing Susie-Q wasn’t malicious, he could forgive her every time she induced twelve hours of sleep followed by twelve to twenty-four hours of feeling lost and irritable, therefore she functioned, if inadvertently, as a teacher of forgiveness and acceptance and empathy, for which he was grateful.They were the last three people, after the movie, to leave the theater. They stood on the sidewalk, unsure what to do next. Fran had planned to go to Coney Island tonight and stay until morning for her birthday, which was today—she’d created a Facebook listing, which Paul remembered seeing—but none of her friends wanted to go, because she didn’t have any, she said. Paul said he also had no friends and that they should celebrate by “eating a lot of food.”At Lovin’ Cup, a bar-restaurant with live music, Fran and Daniel ordered drinks, went outside to smoke. Paul laid the side of his head on his arms, on the table, and closed his eyes. He didn’t feel connected by a traceable series of linked events to a source that had purposefully conveyed him, from elsewhere, into this world. He felt like a digression that had forgotten from what it digressed and was continuing ahead in a confused, choiceless searching.[GET FOOD] Posted by Nate at 7:59 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "EL: GET FOOD",
    "text": "EL: GET FOOD Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GET FOOD Fran and Daniel returned and ordered enchiladas, nachos. Paul ordered tequila, a salad, waffles with ice cream on top.When the food arrived Paul ordered tater tots and more tequila. They ate silently in the loud bar. Paul felt he would need to scream, or exert an effort that would feel like he was screaming, to be heard. He was aware of Fran, to his left, quietly eating with her mouth near her plate, as if to hide something, or probably to reduce the distance to her enchiladas, which in Paul’s peripheral vision appeared shapeless, almost invisible. After Fran left to “do homework,” she said, Paul and Daniel decided to try watching Drugstore Cowboy again, in Paul’s room.On the walk to Daniel’s apartment, to get Drugstore Cowboy, dozens of elderly, similarly dressed Asian men were standing in a loosely organized row, like a string of Christmas lights, seeming bored but alert, on a wide sidewalk, across from Bar Matchless. Daniel asked one of them what movie they were in and the Asian man seemed confused, then said “Martin Scorsese” without an accent when Daniel asked again.Around forty minutes later Paul said “that looks like the group of Asians . . . we saw earlier,” realizing with amazement as he saw Bar Matchless that they had unwittingly walked to the same place.Daniel’s two suitemates were seated at a round, thin, foldable table on chairs Paul immediately viewed as “found on the street,” talking to each other, it seemed, after returning from a concert. Except for a broom and what Daniel confirmed—grimly, Paul felt—was a giant plastic eggplant of unknown origin, there was nothing else in the common room.Daniel’s room had a dresser, mattress pad, wood chair, tiny desk. Within arm’s reach, outside his window, was a brick wall covered with gradients of gray ash. Daniel showed Paul, who felt self-conscious and crowded, standing in place, a candle shaped like a lightbulb and said it was from his sister. Paul stared at it, unable to comprehend, in a way that made the behavior seem unreal, exactly why Daniel was showing it to him, with a feeling that he’d misheard, or not heard, something Daniel said a few seconds or minutes ago.Paul woke sitting on his mattress with his back against a wall, beside Daniel, who seemed asleep and was also sitting. The room was palely lit by a cloudy, faintly pink morning. Paul’s MacBook, in front of them, showed Drugstore Cowboy’s menu screen. Paul shifted a little—his right leg was numb—and Daniel began talking in a clear voice, as if he’d been awake a few minutes already. Daniel wanted to ingest Adderall instead of sleep. Paul, who couldn’t remember if they’d watched the movie, distractedly asked what they would do “all day.”“What we normally do. Walk around. Fix my computer.”“I feel . . . sleepy,” said Paul.Daniel said something about Adderall.“I feel like I’ll still be sleepy,” said Paul.“You’ll be awake, trust me.”“I’m not sure if I want to.”“I feel like you’re eight years old or my girlfriend,” said Daniel around five minutes later.“I really don’t know what I want to do,” said Paul grinning.[ADDERALL] Posted by Nate at 8:01 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "title": "EL: ADDERALL",
    "text": "EL: ADDERALL Tuesday, November 20, 2018 ADDERALL An hour later, after each showering at his own apartment, they met and ingested Adderall and walked to Verb, a café without internet, where they drank iced coffee and ingested a little more Adderall, then went in an adjacent bookstore, where Daniel showed Paul a translated book of nonfiction with a similar cover—off-center black dot, white background—as Shawn Olive’s poetry book.“That’s funny,” said Paul grinning, and they got on the L train, then walked to the Apple store on Prince Street. Daniel’s MacBook, which had files he needed for his job as a research assistant to an elderly ghostwriter (of sports autobiographies) who owed him $200, would require two weeks to be fixed. Daniel asked if Paul would go with him to Rhode Island, in three hours, to stay with Fran’s family for a weekend. Paul declined, saying he hadn’t been invited. Daniel  said he confirmed last week but didn’t want to go anymore and that, a few minutes ago, Fran texted she couldn’t, against expectation, get any Oxycodone—without which it was going to be “unbearable,” Daniel felt, for both himself and Fran, to be around Fran’s family. Paul declined again, saying it seemed stressful. It began raining from a partly sunny sky, and they went in an Urban Outfitters. Daniel walked to a table of books and stood without looking at anything, like a tired child waiting for an overbearingly upbeat mother to finish shopping.“You seem worried,” said Paul.“Sorry. I’m trying to think of an excuse to tell Fran.”     It was sunny and cloudless, around twenty minutes later, when they sat side by side on a bench in Washington Square Park. Daniel swallowed something and mutely handed Paul a 20mg Adderall, which Paul swallowed. Two preadolescent girls ran around the fountain area repeatedly. Paul said he felt like he hadn’t run as fast as possible in probably five or ten years. When the Adderall took effect Daniel began to praise Paul’s writing without restraint or pause for twenty to thirty minutes and asked about Paul’s IQ. Paul said it was either 139 or 154. Daniel was quiet a few seconds, then with a slightly troubled expression said his IQ was higher, seeming like he felt more complicatedly doomed, as a person, with this information. Paul said his mother always said that his and his brother’s IQs were exactly the same, but sometimes also said she was required, as a parent, to say that.Daniel said his sister had multiple doctorates, his parents and aunts and uncles were all high-level professors, but he was “not anything.” Paul knew from previous conversations that Daniel, as a teenager, had been on months-long retreats to Buddhist monasteries, culminating in something like a year alone, when he turned 18, in India or Tibet. Daniel walked away to call Fran and Paul read a text from Erin, a friend he met on the internet, asking when his book-release reading in Brooklyn was and if she could visit him around that time. Paul texted his reading was too far in the future for him to remember the date, and that he would be happy to see her. Daniel returned and said he told Fran his computer had to be fixed today, or not for two weeks, and he needed it to do work, because he hadn’t paid last month’s rent, so wasn’t going to Rhode Island, and that “she got really angry.”“I feel like you did the right thing . . . I mean . . . outside of being honest,” said Paul grinning. “Your relationship with her is more accurate now.”“Your use of the word ‘accurate’ is interesting.”“She has a more accurate view of your view of her now probably,” said Paul.[ERIN] Posted by Nate at 8:03 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Older Post Home"

Paul swallowed two of what he knew was Tylenol 3, one Percocet and, somewhat arbitrarily, he felt, three Advil, then turned off the light, feeling it was hurting his headache.After blearily looking at the internet a little, then peeing and brushing his teeth and washing his face, he lay in darkness on his mattress, finally allowing the simple insistence of the opioid, like an unending chord progression with a consistently unexpected and pleasing manner of postponing resolution, to accumulate and expand, until his brain and heart and the rest of him were contained within the same song-like beating—of another, larger, protective heart—inside of which, temporarily safe from the outside world, he would shrink into the lunar city of himself and feel and remember strange and forgotten things, mostly from his childhood.[REMEMBER] Posted by Nate at 6:36 AM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Home"

    "title": "stafd: REMEMBER",
    "text": "stafd: REMEMBER Tuesday, November 20, 2018 REMEMBER Paul’s father was 28 and Paul’s mother was 24 when they alone (out of a combined fifteen to twenty-five siblings) left Taiwan for America. Paul was born in Virginia six years later, in 1983, when his brother was 7. Paul was 3 when the family moved to Apopka, a pastoral suburb near Orlando, Florida.Paul cried the first day of preschool for around ten minutes after his mother, who was secretly watching and also crying, seemed to have left. It was their first time apart. Paul’s mother watched as the principal cajoled Paul into interacting with his classmates, among whom he was well liked and popular, if a bit shy and “disengaged, sometimes,” said one of the high school students who worked at the preschool, which was called the Discovery Center. Each day, after that, Paul cried less and transitioned more abruptly from crying to interacting with classmates, and by the middle of the second week he didn’t cry anymore. At home, where mostly only Mandarin was spoken, Paul was loud and either slug-like or, his mother would say in English, “hyperactive,” rarely walking to maneuver through the house, only crawling, rolling like a log, sprinting, hopping, or climbing across sofas, counters, tables, chairs, etc. in a game called “don’t touch the ground.” Whenever motionless and not asleep or sleepy, lying on carpet in sunlight, or in bed with eyes open, bristling with undirectionalized momentum, he would want to intensely sprint in all directions simultaneously, with one unit of striving, never stopping. He would blurrily anticipate this unimaginably worldward action, then burst off his bed to standing position, or make a loud noise and violently spasm, or jolt from the carpet into a sprint, flailing his arms, feeling always incompletely satisfied.Paul’s first grade teacher recommended he be placed in the English-as-second-language program, widely viewed as for “impaired” students, but Paul’s mother kept him in the normal class. His second grade teacher recommended he be tested for the “gifted” program and he was admitted and began going every Friday to gifted, in which most of the twenty-five to thirty students, having begun in first grade, were already friends. Paul felt alone on Fridays, but not lonely or uncomfortable or anxious, only that he was in a new and challenging situation without assistance or consequence for failure—a feeling not unlike playing a difficult Nintendo game alone, with no instruction manual. Paul played chess one Friday with Barry, who suggested Paul’s second move. Barry knew more about chess, so was being helpful, Paul thought, and did as suggested for his third move also, then watched an extremely happy Barry dash through the rectangular classroom telling groups of classmates he’d beaten Paul in a four-move check-mate. Paul told three classmates Barry had “tricked him,” then returned to the floor and put the chess pieces away and, with a sensation of seeing a spider crawl out of view inside his room, felt himself reassimilating Barry into the world as a kind of robot-like presence he would always need to be careful around and would never comprehend. In third grade, one morning, Paul finished telling something to his friend Chris, who was strangely unresponsive for a few seconds, then with an exaggeratedly disgusted expression told Paul his breath smelled “horrible” and “brush your teeth,” then turned 180 degrees, in his seat, to talk to someone else. Paul mechanically committed to always brushing his teeth and adjusted his view of Chris to include him, with Barry and 90 to 95 percent of people he’d met, as separate and unknowable.In fourth grade, Paul spent two days with Lori, a second grader in his neighborhood. Lori kissed Paul’s cheek in a tree, then in her room showed him a Mickey Mantle card from her father, who’d said Mickey Mantle had the record for most RBIs. Paul, who collected baseball cards, said Hank Aaron had the record for most RBIs. Lori said he was probably right, because he was really smart. At dusk, the next day, rollerblading on the longest street in the neighborhood, Lori said she needed to try harder than Paul to go the same speed, because her legs were shorter, which Paul thought was insightful.Entering middle school, sixth to eighth grade, Paul wanted to play percussion like three of his friends, including his “best friend,” Hunter, but his piano teacher said percussion would bore him, so he chose trumpet, which he disliked, but continued playing until the summer before high school, when he switched to percussion on the first day of “band camp,” which was ten hours of practice every weekday for two weeks. During lunch break, that day, Paul was practicing alone by silently counting and sometimes tapping a cymbal with a soft-headed mallet when a senior percussionist, the section leader, began teasing him from across the room, saying he was “so cool” and something about his baggy jeans, which his skateboarding brother, at college in Philadelphia, had left in Florida. Paul was unable to think anything, except that he didn’t know what to do, at all, so he committed to doing nothing, which the senior incorporated into his teasing by focusing on how Paul was “too cool” to react, continuing for maybe thirty seconds before commenting briefly on Paul’s hair and leaving the room.Believing that all the senior’s friends and acquaintances, which included almost every person at band camp, now viewed his main effort in life as wanting to be “cool,” which he did want, to some degree, but which now seemed impossible, Paul became increasingly, physically, exclusively critically, nearly continuously self-conscious, the next few days, in ways he hadn’t been before—but probably had been in latent development since preschool—and which affected his musicianship. His middle school friends, including Hunter, among whom he’d been most fearless and at least equally competent at whatever sport or video game, watched him fail every day to play the simplest parts, usually tambourine or triangle, of each piece. The percussion instructor that year punished everyone with push-ups if one person, usually Paul, played something incorrectly more than once. Paul’s friends—subtly, then openly, with confusion and frustration—began to express disbelief at Paul’s inability to count to a number and hit a cowbell or cymbal. Paul was too embarrassed, by the end of the first week, to speak to his friends—all of whom seemed to have easily befriended the section leader and other upperclassmen—and by the second week had begun committing, in certain situations, to not speaking unless asked a question.Two months into freshman year he had committed to not speaking in almost all situations. He felt ashamed and nervous around anyone who’d known him when he was popular and unself-conscious. When he heard laughter, before he could think or feel anything, his heart would already be beating like he’d sprinted twenty yards. As the beating slowly normalized he’d think of how his heart, unlike him, was safely contained, away from the world, behind bone and inside skin, held by muscles and arteries in its place, carefully off-center, as if to artfully assert itself as source and creator, having grown the chest to hide in and to muffle and absorb—and, later, after innovating the brain and face and limbs, to convert into productive behavior—its uncontrollable, indefensible, unexplainable, embarrassing squeezing of itself. To avoid awkwardness, and in respect of his apparent aversion to speaking, Paul’s classmates stopped including him in conversations. The rare times he spoke—in classes where no one knew him, or when, without knowing why, for one to forty minutes, he’d become aggressively confident and spontaneous as he’d been in elementary/middle school, about which his friends poignantly would always seem genuinely excited—he’d feel “out of character,” indicating he’d completed a transformation and was now, in a humorlessly surreal way, exactly what he didn’t want to be and wished he wasn’t.He ate lunch alone, on benches far from the cafeteria, listening to music—his sort of refuge that was like a tunneling in his desolation toward a greater desolation, further from others and himself, closer to the shared source of everything—with portable CD players and earphones, feeling sorry for himself, or vaguely but deeply humbled, though mostly just silent and doomed. Sometimes, thinking of how among fifteen hundred classmates only two others, that he’d noticed, were as socially inept as he—a male in his grade, an obese male one grade lower—Paul would feel a blandly otherworldly excitement, like he must be in some bizarre and extended dream, or lost in the offscreen world of some fictional movie set in an adjacent county.In Paul’s sophomore or junior year he began to believe the only solution to his anxiety, low self-esteem, view of himself as unattractive, etc. would be for his mother to begin disciplining him on her own volition, without his prompting, as an unpredictable—and, maybe, to counter the previous fourteen or fifteen years of “overprotectiveness,” unfair—entity, convincingly not unconditionally supportive. His mother would need to create rules and punishments exceeding Paul’s expectations, to a degree that Paul would no longer feel in control. To do this, Paul believed, his mother would need to anticipate and preempt anything he might have considered, factoring in that—because Paul was thinking about this almost every day, and between the two of them was the source of this belief—he probably already expected, or had imagined, any rule or punishment she would be willing to instate or inflict, therefore she would need to consider rules and punishments that she would not think of herself as willing to instate or inflict. Paul tried to convey this in crying, shouting fights with his mother lasting up to four hours, sometimes five days a week. There was an inherent desperation to these fights, in that each time Paul, in frustration, told his mother how she could have punished him, in whatever previous situation, to make him feel not in control—to, he believed, help solve his social and psychological problems—it became complicatedly more difficult, in Paul’s view, for his mother to successfully preempt his expectations the next time. Paul cried and shouted more than his mother, who only shouted maybe once or twice. Paul would scream if his mother was downstairs while he was upstairs, in his room, where some nights he would throw his electric pencil sharpener and textbooks—and, once, a six-inch cymbal—at his walls, creating holes, resulting in punishments, but never exceeding what, by imagining their possibilities, he’d already rendered unsurprising, predictable. The intensity of these fights maybe contributed to Paul’s lungs collapsing spontaneously three times his senior year, when he was absent forty-seven days and in hospitals for around four weeks.One night, standing in the doorway of his parents’ bedroom, when his father was on a months-long business trip, crying while shouting at his mother, who was supine in bed, in the dark, Paul heard her softly and steadily crying, with her blanket up to her chin in a way that seemed child-like. Paul stopped shouting and stood sobbing quietly, dimly aware, as his face twitched and trembled, that he felt intensely embarrassed of himself from the perspective of any person, except his mother, he had ever met. He said he didn’t know what he was talking about, or what he should do, that he was sorry and didn’t want to complain or blame other people anymore, and felt an ambiguous relief, to have reached the end of a thing without resolution and, having tried hard, feeling allowed—and ready—to resign. He didn’t stop blaming his mother, after that, but gradually they fought less—and, after each fight, when he would revert to his belief about discipline, he would apologize and reiterate he didn’t want to blame anyone or complain—and, by the last month of senior year, had mostly stopped fighting.On one of Paul’s last days of high school he and Lori were both getting rides home from Hunter, who due to a difficulty in refusing requests from people who could see him—in elementary/middle school, whenever a mutual friend rang his doorbell, he and Paul would pretend no one was home— sometimes spent ninety minutes driving classmates home after school. The past eight years, since Lori kissed Paul on the cheek, they’d spoken maybe three times (the day after they rollerbladed together she had begun hanging out with a boy with a “rattail” hairstyle), and the most intimate Paul had been with another girl was a ten-minute conversation, at an “away” high school football game, with another percussionist.Lori repeatedly asked Paul why he wouldn’t speak and, not receiving an answer, began provoking Paul to “say anything,” seeming as committed to eliciting a response as Paul was to not responding. Lori was loudly asking, with genuine and undistracted and bemused curiosity, which Paul felt affection toward and admired, as he stared away from her, out his window, why he couldn’t speak—and if he could just “make any noise”—when Hunter, who’d been talking to someone in the front passenger seat, sort of forced Lori to stop by aggressively asking about her current boyfriend. As he had consistently, the past eight to ten years, Paul felt endeared by Hunter, who used to be an equal, but now—and for the past three or four years—was like an overworked stepfather or sensitive uncle to Paul, the mentally disabled stepson or silent, troubling nephew.[WAKE UP] Posted by Nate at 6:41 AM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Older Post Home"

    "text": "stafd: WAKE UP Tuesday, November 20, 2018 WAKE UP Paul woke on his back, with uncomfortably warm feet, in a bright room, not immediately aware who or where he was, or how he had arrived. Most mornings, with decreasing frequency, probably only because the process was becoming unconscious, he wouldn’t exactly know anything until three to twenty seconds of passive remembering, as if by unzipping a file—newroom.zip—into a PDF, showing his recent history and narrative context, which he’d delete after viewing, thinking that before he slept again he would have memorized this period of his life, but would keep newroom.zip, apparently not trusting himself.Paul felt more committed to viewing the time until September as an interim period, and didn’t have an in-person conversation for more than a week, during which, to his own approval, he seemed to be settling, if precariously, with two days spent mostly eating, into a somewhat productive, loneliness-free routine. He remembered while peeling a banana one night that he had committed, months ago, to a reading in April—in three days, he learned from the internet, in a building near Times Square.

    "text": "stafd: GO TO READING Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO TO READING At the reading, after arriving ten minutes early by accident and talking to the organizer, then sitting alone and, to appear occupied, holding a pen and staring down at what he’d printed in the library—an account of a trip to Germany, fourteen months ago—where he planned to return immediately after he and Frederick, an author in his early 40s, finished reading, Paul began to feel sleepy, in his seat. Yawning, he looked  up and recognized Mitch, 26, a classmate from middle/ high school in Florida, where they had mutual friends but had never spoken to each other, that Paul could remember, approaching from a conspiratorially far distance, like an FBI agent but slower. Mitch had messaged on Facebook, a few weeks ago, that he might attend this reading.“You look the same. What about me?”“Taller,” said Mitch seeming a little nervous.“How can you tell? I’m sitting.”“The shape of your legs, and your body, I think. Something about your bone structure.”After the reading Lucie, 23, introduced herself and Amy, 23, and Daniel, 25, to Paul and Mitch, saying something about her and Amy’s online magazine. Paul asked if they had business cards, not thinking they would. Amy, after encouragement from Lucie, reluctantly gave Paul a business card, seeming a little embarrassed. When Paul looked up from the business card, putting it in his back pocket, he was startled by the sudden appearance of Frederick smiling at him with his arm around Lucie in a manner that seemed calculated, but wasn’t, Paul knew, to firmly establish they were “together.” A bewildered-seeming, middle-aged woman with an Italian accent asked Paul something about agave nectar, wanting it for a diabetic friend, it seemed. Paul said he’d actually learned, a few months ago, that it raised blood sugar as intensely as sugar and that he’d mailed his mother unheated, unfiltered honey, which was the healthiest sweetener—for diabetics, or anyone—based on what he currently knew, which could be wrong, he also knew.In a taxi to a party, forty minutes later, Paul imagined another him walking toward the library and, for a few seconds, visualizing the position and movement of two red dots through a silhouetted, aerial view of Manhattan, felt as imaginary, as mysterious and transitory and unfindable, as the other dot. He visualized the vibrating, squiggling, looping, arcing line representing the three-dimensional movement, plotted in a cubic grid, of the dot of himself, accounting for the different speed and direction of each vessel of which he was a passenger—taxi, Earth, solar system, Milky Way, etc. Adding a fourth dimension, representing time, he visualized the patterned scribbling shooting off in one direction, with a slight wobble, miles from where it was seconds ago. He imagined his trajectory as a vacuum-sealed tube, into which he’d arrived and through which—traveling alone in the vacuum-sealed tube of his own life—he’d be suctioned and from which he’d exit, as a successful delivery to some unimaginable recipient. Realizing this was only his concrete history, his public movement through space-time from birth to death, he briefly imagined being able to click on his trajectory to access his private experience, enlarging the dot of a coordinate until it could be explored like a planet.[GO PARTY][RETURN TO LIBRARY] Posted by Nate at 6:46 AM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Older Post Home"

On a dark street with no people, moving cars, or stores, Paul’s head felt more elevated than normal—and his neck, spindly and gopher-like, more biological and uncontrolled—as he looked in different directions. Paul looked at his phone—staring at its screen for ten to twenty seconds without thinking—and noticed he had a Facebook friend request. Around 90 seconds after accepting Daniel on Facebook, Paul recieved a message from him asking if he was \"still nearby Manhattan.\"  In Washington Square Park Daniel arrived with his friend Fran, 22, whose intriguing gaze, Paul noticed with interest, seemed both disbelieving and transfixed in discernment, as if meticulously studying what she knew she was hallucinating. Daniel was holding Paul's leather jacket, which Paul did not remember losing, or even wearing that night, and said Fran had wanted him to steal it. Paul offered Fran to keep it and each took turns trying on the jacket, which seemed to best fit Paul, who discovered two gigantic vitamin-like pills in one of its pockets upon putting it on. Not wanting to possibly reveal his drug use but feeling an \"urgent\" need to alter his consciousness, Paul put the pills into his mouth in a stereotypically indiscriminate manner he’d previously seen only on TV or in movies. After talking slowly and incoherently, he felt, on topics that didn’t interest him, with increasing calmness, and now feeling peacefully catatonic, like a person in a photograph, except for a pressure to speak and a vague awareness that he couldn’t remember what anyone had said, Paul mentioned that the underground computer labs in Bobst Library were a good place to \"work on things.\" Fran said she wanted to live inside Bobst like \"Bobst Boy,\" a NYU student who spent eight months living in the Library's basement, but that she couldn't get in because she wasn't a student. Paul said he wasn’t a student anymore but someone had made a mistake and given him access until 2012. Daniel asked if Paul liked drugs. Paul replied yes and asked if Daniel liked drugs. Daniel said he liked “benzos” and opiates and had enough money from selling marijuana in San Francisco that he hadn’t had a job in since moving here last autumn. Paul asked if he liked Rilo Kiley and Daniel became quiet a few seconds, seeming worried, like he might not be able to answer, before saying “um, not really.” [GO TO DANIEL'S APARTMENT] Posted by Nate at 9:47 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Newer Post Home"

    "text": "du: GO TO DANIEL'S APARTMENT Tuesday, November 20, 2018 GO TO DANIEL'S APARTMENT Daniel’s two suitemates were seated at a round, thin, foldable table on chairs Paul immediately viewed as “found on the street,” talking to each other, it seemed, after returning from a concert. Except for a broom and what Daniel confirmed—grimly, Paul felt—was a giant plastic eggplant of unknown origin, there was nothing else in the common room.Daniel’s room had a dresser, mattress pad, wood chair, tiny desk. Within arm’s reach, outside his window, was a brick wall covered with gradients of gray ash. Daniel showed Paul, who felt self-conscious and crowded, standing in place, a candle shaped like a lightbulb and said it was from his sister. Paul stared at it, unable to comprehend, in a way that made the behavior seem unreal, exactly why Daniel was showing it to him, with a feeling that he’d misheard, or not heard, something Daniel said a few seconds or minutes ago.“Maybe we should get drunk,” said Daniel, and they entered the kitchen at the end of the hallway. While sitting on an upturned milk crate apparently serving as a stool, Paul felt surreally distant from Daniel—staring into his refrigerator—and like he, in a moment of inattention, might either fall asleep or \"snap awake\" from what increasingly felt like a dream. In the bathroom Paul sat on the toilet for between five and forty seconds then stared at himself in the mirror catatonically for a vague amount of time, aware of something simian about his posture and jaw. When Paul returned, after flushing the toilet and washing his hands for what seemed like ten seconds, he found Daniel in his room lying on his mattress with the light off, watching something on Paul's Macbook. Paul felt himself becoming aware, in a manner that seemed sourceless, that they were now alone in the apartment, and felt himself say, at a sub-speaking volume to himself, it seemed,  “I think I feel depleted.”“What do you mean?”“I feel kind of tired, depleted.”“But you shouldn’t even have started feeling it yet.”“Huh?” said Paul. “I had two capsules of DMZ I forgot I'd left in your jacket, then outside the library you found and ate them.”Paul laughed. “I forgot.”“Jesus. You scare me.”“Sorry,” said Paul grinning, thinking he had definitely read about \"DMZ\" somewhere, but was now content with dismissing any further thoughts on the matter as Daniel seemingly had. Paul sat against a wall—lit by Paul's Macbook from an unknown source that cyclically pulsed from a near—ultraviolet purple to dark red—next to Daniel's mattress. Paul took out his iPhone and emailed himself—I’m sitting against a wall Feel strongly like I simply want to relate my feelings of bleakness in this emailMy legs feel cold—with “Feeling bleak” as the subject. He was lying on his back looking at Twitter, a few minutes later, when for the fifth or sixth time since getting it in January he dropped his iPhone on his face, which did not register in its expression that anything had happened until after impact. He considered emailing himself that his iPhone fell on his face. Then he tried to do what he couldn’t specifically remember having done since college—he chose one of his favorite songs and, with a meekly earnest sympathy toward himself, listened to it on repeat at a high volume and tried to focus only on the drums, or bass guitar, until he was drowsy and decontextualized and memoryless, when he would half-unconsciously remove his  earphones and turn off the music, careful not to be noticed and assimilated by the world, and disappear into the reachable mirage of sleep.But he couldn’t focus on the music. He couldn’t ignore a feeling that he wasn’t alone—that, in the brain of the universe, where everything that happened was concurrently recorded as public and indestructible data, he was already partially with everyone else that had died. The information of his existence, the etching of which into space-time was his experience of life, was being studied by millions of entities, billions of years from now, who knew him better than he would ever know himself. They knew everything about him, even his current thoughts, in their exact vagueness, as he moved distractedly toward sleep, studying him in their equivalent of middle school “maybe,” thought some fleeting aspect of Paul’s consciousness, unaware what it was referencing. <DMZ Dream Packet 1>[?] Posted by Nate at 9:58 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Older Post Home"
